<h2 class="nobreak p4" id="INTRODUCTION">INTRODUCTION</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">We</span> learn through the functioning of our senses;
sight the most precious shows us the appearance
of the exterior world. Before the dawn
of pictorial presentation, man was visually cognizant
only of his immediate or present surroundings.
On the development of realistic picturing
it was possible, more or less truthfully, to
become acquainted with the aspect of things not
proximately perceivable. The cogency of the
perceptive impression was dependent upon the
graphic faithfulness of the agency—a pictorial
work—that gave the visual representation of the
distant thing.</p>

<p>It is by means of sight, too, that the mind
since the beginning of alphabets has been made
familiar with the thoughts and the wisdom of
the past and put into relationship with the learning
and reasoning of the present. These two
methods of imparting knowledge—delineatory<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vi">[vi]</span>
and by inscribed symbols—have been concurrent
throughout the ages.</p>

<p>It was nearly a century ago that Joseph Nicéphore
Niepce (1765-1833), at Châlons-sur-Saône,
in France, invented photography. Since that time
it has been possible to fix on a surface, by physicochemical
means, pictures of the exterior world.
It was another way of extending man’s horizon,
but a way not dependent, in the matter of literalness,
upon the variations of any individual’s skill
or intent, but rather upon the accuracy of material
means.</p>

<p>Thoughts and ideas once represented and preserved
by picture-writing, recorded by symbolical
signs, and at last inscribed by alphabetical marks
were, in 1877, registered by mere tracings on a
surface and again reproduced by Mr. Edison with
his phonograph. As in the photograph, the procedure
was purely mechanical, and man’s artificial
inventions of linear markings and arbitrary symbols
were totally disregarded.</p>

<p>Through photography we learn of the exterior
nature of absent things and the character of the
views in distant places. Or it preserves these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vii">[vii]</span>
pictorial matters in a material form for the future.
The phonograph communicates to us the uttered
thoughts of others or brings into our homes the
melodies and songs of great artists that we should
not otherwise have the opportunity to hear.</p>

<p>And now a new physicochemical marvel has
come that apprehends, reproduces, and guards
for the future another sensorial stimulus. It is
the motion-picture and the stimulus is movement.</p>

<p>Photography and the rendering of sounds by
the phonograph have both been adopted for instruction
and amusement. The motion-picture
also is used for these purposes, but in the main
the art has been associated with our leisure hours
as a means of diversion or entertainment. During
the period of its growth, however, its adaptability
to education has never been lost sight of.
It is simply that development along this line has
not been as seriously considered as it should be.
Motion-pictures, it is true, that may be considered
as educational are frequently shown in theatres
and halls. Such, for instance, are views in strange
lands, scenic wonders, and pictures showing the
manufacture of some useful article or the manner<span class="pagenum" id="Page_viii">[viii]</span>
of proceeding in some field of human activity.
But these are effected entirely by photography
and the narration of their making does not come
within the scope of this book.</p>

<p>Our concern is the description of the processes
of making “animated cartoons,” or moving screen
drawings. Related matters, of course, including
the inception and the development of motion-pictures
in general, will be referred to in our work.
At present, of the two divisions of our subject,
the art of the animated comic cartoon has been
most developed. It is for this reason that so much
of the book is given to an account of their production.</p>

<p>But on the making of animated screen drawings
for scientific and educational themes little has
been said. This is not to be taken as a measure
of their importance.</p>

<p>It is interesting to regard for a moment the
vicissitudes of the word cartoon. Etymologically
it is related to words in certain Latin tongues for
paper, card, or pasteboard. Its best-accepted
employment—of bygone times—was that of
designating an artist’s working-size preliminary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_ix">[ix]</span>
draft of a painting, a mural decoration, or a design
for tapestry. Raphael’s cartoons in the
South Kensington Museum, in London, are the
best-known works of art coming under this meaning
of the term. (They are, too, the usual instances
given in dictionaries when this meaning is
explained.) The most frequent use of the word
up to recently, however, has been to specify a
printed picture in which the composition bears
upon some current event or political topic and in
which notabilities of the day are generally caricatured.
The word cartoon did not long particularize
this kind of pictorial work but was soon applied
to any humorous or satirical printed picture
no matter whether the subject was on a topic of
the day or not.</p>

<p>When some of the comic graphic artists began
to turn their attention to the making of drawings
for animated screen pictures, nothing seemed
more natural than that the word “animated”
should be prefixed to the term describing their
products and so bringing into usage the expression
“animated cartoons.” But the term did
not long remain restricted to this application, as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_x">[x]</span>
it soon was called into service by the workers in
the industry to describe any film made from
drawings without regard to whether the subject
was of a humorous or of an educational character.
Its use in this sense is perhaps justified
as it forms a convenient designation in the trade
to distinguish between films made from drawings
and those having as their basic elements actuality,
that is, people, scenes, and objects.</p>

<p>Teachers now are talking of “visual instruction.”
They mean by this phrase in the special
sense that they have given to it the use of motion-picture
films for instructional purposes. Travel
pictures to be used in connection with teaching
geography or micro-cinematographic films for
classes in biology are good examples of such films.
But not all educational subjects can be depicted
by the camera solely. For many themes the
artist must be called in to prepare a series of drawings
made in a certain way and then photographed
and completed to form a film of moving diagrams
or drawings.</p>

<p>As it is readily understood that any school
topic presented in animated pictures will stimulate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xi">[xi]</span>
and hold the attention, and that the properties
of things when depicted in action are more
quickly grasped visually than by description or
through motionless diagrams, it is likely that visual
instruction by films will soon play an important
part in any course of studies. Then the motion-picture
projector will become the pre-eminent
school apparatus and such subjects as do not
lend themselves to photography will very generally
need to be drawn; thereupon the preponderance of
the comic cartoon will cease and the animated
screen drawing of serious and worth-while themes
will prevail.</p>

<br>THE BEGINNING OF ANIMATED DRAWINGS</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uc">The</span> picture thrown on the wall by the magic-lantern,
although an illusion, and no more
tangible than a shadow, has nevertheless a certain
tactile quality. If it is projected from a drawing
on a glass slide, its design is definite; and if
from a photographic slide, the tones are clearly
discernible. It is—unless it is one of those quaintly
moving amusing subjects operated by a crude
mechanism—a quiescent picture. The spirited
screen picture thrown by the lens of a motion-picture
projector is an illusion, too. It exemplifies,
however, two varieties of this class of sensory deceptions.
First: it is an illusion for the same
reason that the image from the magic-lantern
is one; namely, a projected shadow of a more or
less opaque design on a transparent material intervening
between the illuminant and the lens.
And secondly, it is an illusion in that it synthesizes
mere pictorial spectres into the appearance of life
and movement. This latter particular, the seeming<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>
activity of life, is the fundamental dissimilarity
between pictures projected by the magic-lantern
and those thrown on the screen by the motion-picture
apparatus.</p>

<p>And it is only the addition to the magic-lantern,
of a mechanism that makes possible this optical
vibration of life and motion, that constitutes the
differing feature in the two types of projecting
machines.</p>

<p>In the magic-lantern and its improved form,
the stereopticon, separate views of different subjects
are shown in succession. Each picture is
allowed to remain on the screen long enough to
be readily beheld and appreciated. But the picture
is at rest and does not move. With the motion-picture
projector a series of slightly varying
pictures of the same subject are projected in quick
succession. This succession is at such a rapid
rate that the interval of time during which one
picture moves out of place to make way for the
next is so short that it is nearly imperceptible.
In consequence, the slightly varying pictures
blend on the screen and we have a phantasmagoria
of movement.</p>

<p>The phenomenon of this movement—this semblance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
to life—takes place, not on the screen, but
within the eye. Its consideration, a subject proper
for the science of physiology (and in some aspects
psychology), has weight for us more particularly
as a matter of physics.</p>

<p>Memory has been said to be an attribute of
all organic matter. An instance of this seems to
be the property of the eye to retain on its retina
an after-image of anything just seen. That is
to say, when an object impresses its image upon
the retina and then moves away, or disappears,
there still remains, for a measurable period, an
image of this object within the eye. This singularity
of the visual sense is spoken of as the persistence
of vision or the formation of positive
after-images. And it is referred to as a positive
after-image in contradistinction to another visional
phenomenon called the negative after-image.
This latter kind is instanced in the well-known
experiment of fixing the eyes for a few
moments upon some design in a brilliant color
and quickly turning away to gaze at a blank
space of white where instantly the same design
will be seen, but of a color complementary to
that of the particular hue first gazed at.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span></p>

<p>The art of the motion-picture began when
physicists first noticed this peculiarity of the
organ of sight in retaining after-images. The
whole art is based on its verity. It is the special
quality of the visual sense that makes possible
the appreciation of living screen pictures.</p>

<p>An interesting matter to bear in mind is the
circumstance that the first attempt at giving to
a screen image the effect of life was by means of
a progressive series of drawings. When photographs
came later, drawings were forgotten and
only when the cinematographic art had reached
its great development and universality, were
drawings again brought into use to be synthesized
on the screen.</p>

<p>To describe how these drawings are made,
their use and application to the making of animated
cartoons, is the purpose of this book.</p>

<p>Before proceeding with a sketch of the development
of the art of making these cartoons,
it will make the matter more readily understood if
we give, at first, in a few paragraphs, a brief
description of the present-day method of throwing
a living picture on the screen by the motion-picture
projector.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span></p>

  <img class="w100" src="images/i_007.png" alt="Reflector; Light; Condenser; Objective; Screen">
  <figcaption class="caption">MAGIC-LANTERN AND MOTION-PICTURE PROJECTOR
COMPARED.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The projector for motion-pictures, like the
magic-lantern, consists of an illuminant, reflector,
condenser, and objective. This last part is the
combination of lenses that gather and focus the
light rays carrying the pencils of lights and
shadows composing the picture and throwing
them on the screen. There is, in the magic-lantern,
immediately back of the objective, a narrow aperture<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
through which the glass slide holding a picture
is thrust. In the motion-picture apparatus, the
transparent surface containing the picture also
passes back of the objective, but instead of the
simple process of pushing one slide through to
make way for another, there is a complicated
mechanism to move a long ribbon containing
the sequence of pictures that produces the image
on the screen. Now this ribbon consists of a strip
of transparent celluloid<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> each with a separate
photograph of some one general scene but each
with slight changes in the moving details—objects
or figures. These changes record the movements
from the beginning to the end of the particular
story, action, or pantomime.</p>

<p>Along the edges of the ribbons are rows of
perforations that are most accurately equalized
with respect to their size and of the distances
between them. It is by means of wheels with
teeth that engage with the perforations and the
movement of another toothed part of the mechanism<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
that the ribbon or film is carried across the
path of light in the projecting machine. The
device for moving the film, although not of a
very intricate character, is nevertheless of an ingenious
type. It is intermittent in action and
operates so that one section of film, containing a
picture, is held in the path of light for a fraction
of a second, moved away and another section,
with the next picture, brought into place to be
projected in its turn. This way of working, in
most of the projectors, is obtained by the use of
a mechanical construction known as the Geneva
movement. The pattern of its principal part is
a wheel shaped somewhat like a Maltese cross.
The form shown in the illustration is given as a
type; not all are of this pattern, nor are they all
four-parted.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp70" id="i_009" >
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_009.png" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption">FOUR PHASES OF THE ACTION OF THE INTERMITTENT
GEARING KNOWN AS THE GENEVA MOVEMENT.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span></p>

<p>It is obvious that while one picture moves out
of the way for the next, there would be a blur on
the screen during such a movement if some means
were not devised to prevent it. This is found
by eclipsing the light during the time of the change
from one picture to another. The detail of the
projector that effects this is a revolving shutter
with a solid part and an open section. (This is
the old type of shutter. It is noticed here because
the way in which the light rays project the picture
is easily explained by using it as an example.)
This shutter is so geared with the rest of the mechanism
that (1) the solid part passes across the
path of light while another picture is moving into
place; and that (2) the open section passes across
the path of light while a rectangular area containing
a picture is at rest and its details are being
projected on the screen.</p>

<p>It may be asked, at this point, why the eye is
not aware on the screen of the passing shadow
of the opaque part of the shutter as it eclipses the
light. It would seem that there should be either
a blur or a darkened period on the screen. But
the mechanism moves so rapidly that the passing
of the solid portion of the shutter is not ordinarily
perceptible.</p>

<p>One foot of celluloid film contains sixteen separate
pictures, and these pass in front of the light
in one second. One single tiny picture of the film
takes up then one-sixteenth of a second. But
not all of this fraction of a second is given to the
projection of the picture as some of the time is
taken up with moving it into place immediately
before projection. The relative apportionment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
of this period of one-sixteenth of a second is so
arranged that about five-sixths of it (five ninety-sixths
of a second) is given to the holding of the
film at rest and the projection of its picture, and
the remaining one-sixth (one ninety-sixth of a
second) is given to the movement of a section of
the film and the shutting off of the light by the
opaque part of the shutter.</p>

<p>In the last few paragraphs we have referred
to the old type of shutter which caused a
flicker, or unsteadiness of light on the screen.
Nowadays a three-bladed shutter that nearly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
does away with an unsteady light is in general
use. Its operation, approximately for the purposes
of description is like this: It turns once in
one-sixteenth of a second; one-sixth of this time
is taken up with the moving of the film and the
eclipsing of the light by one blade of the shutter.
During the remainder of the time—five-sixths of
it, the following takes place: the film is stationary
and ready for projection, then two blades of the
shutter and three of its open sections pass across
the path of the light.</p>


<figure class="figright illowp30" id="i_015" >

  <figcaption class="caption">SECTION OF AN ANIMATED CARTOON FILM
<ins id="size" class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;removed additional text: Exact size.">.</ins> </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>From this it can be seen that when the picture is viewed on the
screen, there are actually two short moments when the light rays are
cut off. This is not perceived by the spectator on account of the
speed of the revolving shutter and the strong illuminant. Instead, the
use of a shutter of this pattern evens the screen lighting by making
an equal apportioning of light flashes and dark periods. With the
old shutter there was one long period of light and one short period
of darkness. It was this unequal distribution that gave rise to the
flicker. At times, under certain conditions, a two-bladed shutter is
used also.</p>

<p>A reel of film may vary in length for a short<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_14">[14]</span> subject of fifty feet (or even less), to a
very long “feature” of a mile or so in length. In width, the strip of
celluloid measures one and three-eighths inches. Between the two rows
of perforations that engage with the teeth on the sprocket-wheels and
by which a certain part of the intermittent mechanism pulls the film
along, are little rectangular panels, already alluded to, containing
the photographs. Sometimes these panels are called “frames,” generally
though, in the parlance of the trade, they are simply designated as
“pictures.” They measure one inch across and three-quarters of an inch
in height.</p>

<p>As noted above, these frames contain photographs of scenes that
record, by changes in their action, the incidents and episodes of the
story of any particular reel. In the case of animated cartoons, the
frames on the film also contain photographs, but these photographs are
made from sets of progressive drawings depicting the action of the
characters of the animated cartoon.</p>

<p>In concluding this brief account of the modern motion-picture, the
attention is directed, as the subject is studied, to a few details of
the mechanism and to the general procedure that are found to be<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span> elementary features in
nearly all apparatus used during the round of years that the art was
developing. They are as follows: (1) A series of pictures—drawings
or photographs—representing an action by progressive changes in
their delineation. (2) Their presentation, one at a time, in rapid
succession. (3) Their synthesis, directly upon the retina of the
eye, or projected on a screen and then viewed by the eye. (4) Some
means by which light—or the vision—is shut off while the change from
one picture to another is taking place. (Projecting machines have
been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span> made, however, in
which the film is moved so rapidly, and in a particular way, that a
shutter to eclipse the light is not needed.)</p>

<p>Now, as stated before, the phenomenon of the
persistence of vision is the fundamental physiological
fact upon which the whole possibility of seeing
screen pictures rests. One of the first devices
made that depended upon it, and that very simply
demonstrated this faculty of the retina for holding
a visional image for a time, was an optical toy
called the thaumatrope. It dates from about
1826. It was a cardboard disk with two holes
close to the edge at opposite points. Strings were
passed through these holes and fastened and the
dangling ends held and rolled between the thumbs
and fingers so that the disk was made to twirl
rapidly. Each side of the disk had a picture
printed or drawn upon it. These two pictures
when viewed together while the disk was twirled
appeared as one complete picture. A favorite
design for depiction was an empty bird-cage on
one side and a bird on the other. The designs
were placed with respect to each other in the same
way as the marks and insignia of the two sides
of most coins. (The coins of Great Britain are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
an exception, on them the designs are placed
differently. In reading their marks or looking
at the images of the two sides, we turn the coin
over like the page of a book.)</p>

other.</p>

<p class="subcap"><em>Below</em>: The combined image when the thaumatrope is twirled.</p>
</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The thaumatrope illustrates the persistence of
vision in a very elementary way. Simply explained,
the face of one side of the disk with its
design is before the eye, the design impresses its
true image upon the retina, the disk turns away
and the picture disappears, but its after-image
remains on the retina. The disk having turned,
brings the other picture into view. Its true image
is impressed upon the retina to blend with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
after-image of the first picture. In rapid sequence
this turning continues and the two images commingle
to give the fantasy of a perfect design.</p>

<p>A limited number of subjects only were suitable
for demonstration by a toy of this character. Two
other subjects were those showing designs to give
the effect of a rider on a horse and a tight-rope
dancer balanced on a rope.</p>

<p>Later when scientific investigators were busy
inquiring into the phenomena of visual distortions
exhibited by the spokes and teeth of turning wheels<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
when seen in contrast with certain intervening
objects, a curious apparatus was contrived by
Faraday the English scientist (1791-1867). This
apparatus was so constructed that two disks were
made to travel, by cogged gearing, in opposite
directions, but at the same speed. Around the
circumferences of the disks were cut narrow slots
at equal distances apart and so making the solid
portions between them like teeth, or spokes of a
wheel.</p>

<p class="subcap center">With the disks moving as marked, the disk <i>B</i> will appear to be motionless

</figure>

<p>When this machine was set in motion and the
eye directed through the moving and blurred
teeth of the front disk toward the far disk, this
far disk appeared to be stationary. Its outline—the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
teeth, slots, and circumference—were distinctly
seen and not blurred.</p>

<p>Then it was found that the same effect could
be obtained with the use of one slotted disk by
simply holding it in front of a mirror and viewing
the reflected image through the moving slots of
the disk. The reflection answered for the second
disk of the instrument of the first experiment.</p>

<p class="subcap center">When the disk is twirled the reflections of its spokes appear stationary

</figure>

<p>From this type of optical toy it was but a step
to the contriving of various types of instruments
constructed on the pattern of a slotted disk, or
some sort of a turning mechanism with a series of
apertures, to use in giving the illusion of movement
in connection with drawings or photographs.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
The best-known was the phenakistoscope, the
invention of which has been credited to the Belgian
physicist, Plateau (1801-1883). This toy
was a large cardboard disk with pictures on one
side that were to be viewed by their reflections
through slots in the disk while it was held before
a mirror. The pictures drawn in sequence represented
some action, as a horse running, an acrobat,
a juggler, or some amusing subject that could
be drawn easily in a cycle of actions and that
would lend itself to repetition.</p>

<figure class="figright illowp50" id="i_021" >
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_021.png" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption">Holding a phenakistoscope before a mirror
and ready to twirl it around.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The phenakistoscope has some rough resemblance
in its plan to a motion-picture projector—the
cycle of slightly different drawings represents
the film with its sequence of tiny pictures; the slots
in the disk by which
the drawings are
viewed in the mirror
correspond to the
open sections of the
revolving shutter;
while the solid portions
of the disk answer
to the opaque
parts of the shutter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span></p>

<p>As it only was possible in the phenakistoscope
that one person at a time could view conveniently
the reflected pictures, the attempt was made to
arrange it for projection. A lens was added with
a light and mirrors so that a number of people
could see its operation at the same time. In another
form the pictures were placed on a glass
disk which was made to rotate back of a magic-lantern
objective.</p>

  <img class="w100" src="images/i_022.png" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption">PHENAKISTOSCOPE COMBINED WITH A MAGIC-LANTERN.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>When the number of slots in a phenakistoscope
correspond to the number of drawings in the cycle,
the different figures of the cycle are in action but
they do not move from the place where they are
depicted. Only their limbs, if it is an action in
which these parts are brought into play, are in
movement. But if there is one slot more and the
disk turned in the proper direction, the row of
drawings will appear to be going around a circle.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
This is particularly adapted to series of running
animals.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption">PHENAKISTOSCOPE WITH A CYCLE OF DRAWINGS TO SHOW
A DOG IN MOVEMENT.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Another method of giving the semblance of
motion to a series of progressive drawings, soon
devised after the invention of the phenakistoscope,
was the zootrope, or wheel of life. It embodied
the idea, too, of a rapidly moving opaque<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
flat portion with a row of slots passing between
the eye and the drawings.</p>

<p>In form the zootrope was like a cylindrical
lidless box of cardboard. It was pivoted and
balanced on a vertical rod so that it could be
made to turn easily and very rapidly. The
slots were cut around the upper rim of the box.
Long strips of paper holding pictures fitted into
the box. When one of these strips was put in
place, it was so adjusted that any particular drawing
of the series could be viewed through a slot
of the opposite side. These drawings appeared
to be in motion when the zootrope was made to
twirl.</p>

  <img class="w100" src="images/i_024.png" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption">THE ZOOTROPE.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>This type of optical curiosity, as a matter of
priority, is associated with the name of Desvignes,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
as he obtained a patent for it in England in 1860.
Later in 1867, a United States patent was issued
for a similar instrument to William Lincoln, of
Providence, R. I. He called his device the
zoetrope.</p>

<p>This cylindrical synthesizing apparatus was
sold as a toy for many years. Bands of paper
with cycles of drawings of a variety of humorous
and entertaining subjects thereon were prepared
for use with it.</p>

<p>But the busy inventors were not satisfied with
the simple form in which it was first fabricated.
Very soon from the zootrope was evolved another<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
optical curiosity that preserved the general cylindrical
plan, but made use of the reflective
property of a mirror to aid the illusion. This
was the praxinoscope of M. Reynaud, of France.
He perfected it and adapted its principles to create
other forms of rotating mechanisms harmonizing
progressive drawings to show movement.</p>

  <img class="w100" src="images/i_026.png" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><i>A.</i> REYNAUD’S PRAXINOSCOPE.

<br><i>B.</i> PLAN OF THE PRAXINOSCOPE.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span></p>

<p>The praxinoscope held to the idea of a box,
cylindrical and lidless, and pivoted in the centre
so that it turned. The strip of drawings, and the
plan of placing them inside of the box—two
features of the zootrope—were both retained.
But instead of looking at the drawings through
apertures in the box rim, they were observed by
their reflections in mirrors placed on an inner
section or drum. The mirrors were the same in
number as the drawings and turned with the
rest of the apparatus. The mirrors were placed
on the drum—the all-important point in the construction
of the praxinoscope—half-way between
the centre and the inner side of the rim of the
box. As the drawings were placed here, the eye,
looking over the rim of the box, viewed their reflections
in the mirrors. But the actual place
of a reflection was the same distance back of the
surface of a mirror that a drawing was in front
of it; namely, at the dead centre of the rotating
cylinder. It was here, at this quiet point, that
it was possible to see the changing images of the
succession of graduated drawings blending to give
the illusion of motion.</p>

<p>Reynaud next fixed his praxinoscope with improvements<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
that made the characters in his drawings
appear to be going through a performance
on a miniature stage. He called his new contrivance
the theatre praxinoscope. This new mechanism,
was fixed in a box before which was
placed a mask-like section to represent a proscenium.
Another addition in front of this had a
rectangular peep-hole and small cut-out units of
stage scenery that were reflected on the surface
of a glass inserted into the proscenium opening.</p>

  <img class="w100" src="images/i_028.png" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption">THE THEATRE PRAXINOSCOPE.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Not satisfied with this toy theatre, Reynaud’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
next step was to combine with the praxinoscope,
condensers, lenses, and an illuminant with which
to project the images on a screen, so that spectators
in an auditorium could see the illusion.
A more intricate mechanism, again, was later
devised by Reynaud. This was his optical theatre
in which there was used an endless band of graduated
drawings depicting a rather long pantomimic
story. It, of course, was an enlargement of
the idea of the simple early form of praxinoscope
with its strip of paper containing the drawings.
But this optical theatre had such a complication
of mirrors and lenses that the projected light
reached the screen somewhat diminished in illuminating
power, and the pictures were consequently
dimmed.</p>

<p>From the time of the invention of the thaumatrope
in 1826, and throughout the period when
the few typical machines noted above were in
use, drawings only in graduated and related series,
were applied in the production of the illusion of
movement.</p>

<p>Drawings, too, were first employed for a little
optical novelty in book-form, introduced about
1868, called the kineograph. It consisted of a
number of leaves, with drawings on one side,
firmly bound along an edge. The manner of its
manipulation was to cause the leaves to flip from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
under the thumb while the book was held in the
hands. The pictures, all of a series depicting
some action of an entertaining subject, passed
quickly before the vision as they slipped from
under the thumb
and <ins class="corr" id="give" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;original text: give">gave</ins> a continuous
action of
the particular

<p>Now when the
camera began to
be employed in
taking pictures of
figures in action,
one of the first
uses made of such
pictures was to
put a series of them into the book-form so as to

to flip from under the thumb, the visional deception
of animated photographs.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uc">Although</span> the possibilities of taking pictures
photographically was known as early
as the third decade of the nineteenth century,
drawings only were used in the many devices
for rendering the illusion of movement. In the
preceding chapter in which we have given a brief
history of the early efforts of synthesizing related
pictures, typical examples of such instruments
have been given. But the pictorial elements used
in them were always drawings.</p>

<p>It was not until 1861 that photographic prints
were utilized in a machine to give an appearance
of life to mere pictures. This machine was that
of Mr. Coleman Sellers, of Philadelphia. His
instrument brought stereoscopic pictures into the
line of vision in turn where they were viewed
by stereoscopic lenses. Not only did this arrangement
show movement by a blending of related
pictures but procured an effect of relief.</p>

THE ILLUSION OF LIFE TO A SERIES OF PHOTOGRAPHS.<br>

</div></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>It is to be remembered that in the days of Mr.
Sellers, photography did not have among its means
any method of taking a series of pictures on a
length of film, but the separate phases of a movement
had to be taken one at a time on plates.
The ribbon of sensitized film, practical and dependable,
did not come until more than twenty-five
years later. Its introduction into the craft
was coincident with the growth of instantaneous
photography.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span></p>

<p>When scientists began to study movement with
the aid of instantaneous photographs, they quite
naturally cared less for synthesizing the pictorial
results of their investigations than they did for
merely observing and recording exactly how
movement takes place.</p>

<p>At first diagrams and drawings were used by
students of movement to fix in an understandable
way the facts gained by their inquiries. In England,
for instance, Mr. J. Bell Pettigrew (1834-1908)
illustrated his works with a lot of carefully
made diagrammatic pictures. He made many interesting
observations on locomotion and gave
much attention to the movement of flying creatures,
adding some comment, too, on the possibility
of artificial flight.</p>

<p>Again in Paris, M. E. J. Marey (whose work is
to be considered a little farther on) embellished
his writings with charts and diagrams that were
made with the aid of elaborate apparatus for the
timing of animals in action and the marking of
their footprints on the ground. Then he traced,
too, by methods that involved much labor and
patience, the trajectory of a bird’s wing. And
in his continued searching out of the principles<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
of flight registered by ingenious instruments the
wing-movements in several kinds of insects.</p>

<p>In our first chapter no instructions were given
as to how animated cartoons are made. And
although this is the specific purpose of the book,
we must again in this chapter refer but slightly
to the matter, as there is need that we first devote
some time to chronicling the early efforts in solving
animal movements by the aid of photography.
Then we must touch, too, upon the modes of the
synthesis of analytic photographs for the purpose
of screen projection.</p>

<p>Both these matters are pertinent to our theme:
the animated screen artist makes use of instantaneous
photographs for the study of movement,
and the same machine that projects the photographic
film is also used for the animated cartoon
film made from his drawings.</p>

<p>What appears to have been the first use of
photographs to give a screen synthesis in an auditorium,
was that on an evening in February,
1870, at the Academy of Music, in Philadelphia.
It was an exhibition given by Mr. Henry R. Heyl,
of his phasmatrope. He showed on a screen, life-sized
figures of dancers and acrobats in motion.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
The pictures were projected, with the aid of a
magic-lantern, from photographs on thin glass
plates that were placed around a wheel which
was made to rotate. A “vibrating shutter” cut
off the light while one photograph moved out of
the way, and another came in to take its place.
The wheel had spaces for eighteen photographs.
It was so planned that those of one set could be
taken out and those of another slipped in to
change a subject for projection.</p>

<p>The photographs used in the phasmatrope
were from posed models; a certain number of
which were selected to form a cycle so that the
series could be repeated and a continuous performance
be given by keeping the wheel going.
At this period there were no pliant sensitized
ribbons to take a sequence of photographs of a
movement, and Heyl had to take them one at
a time on glass plates by the wet collodion
process.</p>

<p>A notable point about this early motion-picture
show was that it was quite like one of our day,
for according to Heyl, in his letter to the  <cite>Journal
of the Franklin Institute</cite>, he had the orchestra
play appropriate music to suit the action of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
the dancers and the grotesqueries of the acrobats.</p>

<p>Better known in the fields of the study of movement
and that of instantaneous photography and
pictorial synthesis are M. Marey, already mentioned
(1830-1904), and his contemporary, Mr. E.
Muybridge (1830-1904). While Marey conducted
his inquiries in Paris, Muybridge pursued his
studies in San <ins class="corr" id="Francisco" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;original text: Franscisco">Francisco</ins> and Philadelphia.</p>

<p>Marey, who in the beginning recorded the
changes and modification of attitudes in movement
by diagrams and charts, later used diagrams
made from photographs and then photographs
themselves. He studied the phases of movement
from a strictly scientific standpoint, in human
beings, four-footed beasts, birds, and nearly all
forms of life. And he did not neglect to note
the speed and manner of moving of inorganic
bodies, such as falling objects, agitated and whirling
threads.</p>

comprehensive analytical study of movement in human figures and animals.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Muybridge, on the other hand, seemed to have
a trend toward the educational, in a popular sense
of the word; and had a faculty of giving his
works a pictorial quality. He showed this in the
choice of his subjects and the devising of machines
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>that combined his photographs somewhat successfully
in screen projection.</p>

<p>In Muybridge’s first work in which he photographed
a horse in motion, he used a row of
cameras in front of which the horse proceeded.
The horse in passing before them, and coming
before each particular camera, broke a string connected
with its shutter. This in opening exposed
the plate and so pictured the horse at that moment,
and in the particular attitude of that moment.
This breaking of a string, opening of a
shutter, and so on, took place before each camera.
Muybridge in his early work used the collodion
wet plate, a serious disadvantage. Later he had
the convenience of the sensitized dry plate and
was also able to operate the cameras by motors.</p>

<p>When Marey began to employ a camera in his
researches he registered the movements of an
entire action on one plate; while Muybridge’s
way was to take but one phase of an action on
one plate. The two men differed greatly in their
objects and methods. Marey in his early experiments,
at least, traced on one plate or chart the
successive changes in attitudes of limbs or parts,
or the positions of certain fixed points on his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
models. But Muybridge procured single but
related pictures of attitudes assumed by his subjects
in a connected and orderly sequence. The
latter method lent itself more readily to adaptation
for the projecting lantern and so became
popularly appreciated. Perhaps it is for this
reason that Muybridge has been referred to as
the father of the motion-picture.</p>

<p>The photographic gun was Marey’s most novel
camera. With this he caught on a glass plate
the movements of flying birds. This instrument
was suggested by a similar one used by M.
Janssen, the astronomer, in 1874, to make a photographic
record of the transit of a planet across
the sun’s disk.</p>

<p>The kineograph, mentioned at the beginning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
of this chapter, by which the illusion
of motion was given to a series
of pictures arranged like a book,
formed the basic idea for a number
of other popular
contrivances. One
of these was the
mutoscope, in which
the leaves were fastened
by one edge to
an axis in such a
way that they stood
out like spokes. The
machine in operation
brought one
leaf for a moment
at rest under the gaze of the eye and then allowed
it to snap away to expose another picture
in its place. When this was viewed in its turn,
it also disappeared to make way for the next in
order.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption">PLAN OF LUMIÈRE’S KINORA.

<p class="subcap center">An apparatus similar in principle
to the mutoscope.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>As yet experimenters were not altogether sure
in what particular way to combine a series of
graduated pictures so as to produce one living
image. Besides the ways that have been exemplified<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
in the apparatus so far enumerated,
some experimenters tried to put photographs
around the circumference of a large glass disk
somewhat on the order of the phenakistoscope.
Heyl’s phasmatrope, of 1870, was on this order.</p>

<p>On this plan of a rotating disk, Muybridge
constructed his zoöpraxiscope by which he projected
some of his animal photographs. Another
expedient tried by some one was that of putting
a string of minute pictures spirally on a drum
which was made to turn in a helix-like fashion.
The pictures were enlarged by a lens and brought
into view back of a shutter that worked intermittently.</p>

<p>Although the dry plate assuredly was a great
improvement over the slow and troublesome
old-fashioned wet plate, there was felt the need
of some pliant material that could be sensitized
for photography and that could furthermore be
made in the form of a ribbon. The suitableness
of the paper strips for use in the zootrope and
the praxinoscope obviously demonstrated the
advantages of an elongated form on which to
put a series of related pictures.</p>

<p>Experiments were made to obtain a pliant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
ribbon for the use. Transparent paper was at
one time tried but found unadaptable. Eventually
the celluloid film came into use, and it is
this material that is now generally in use to
make both the ordinary snap-shot film and the
“film stock” for the motion-picture industry.</p>

<p>Edison’s kinetoscope of 1890, or more particularly
its improved form of 1893, that found immediate
recognition on its exhibition at the <ins class="corr" id="words" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;original text: Word’s">World’s</ins>
Fair at Chicago, was the first utilization on a
large scale of the celluloid film for motion-pictures.
It is to be remarked, however, that in
the kinetoscope the pictures were viewed, not
on a screen in an auditorium by a number of
people, but by one person at a time peering
through a sight opening in the apparatus. It
was the kinetoscope, it appears, that set others
to work devising ways of using celluloid bands
for projecting pictures on a screen.</p>

<p>While some inventors were busy in their efforts
to construct workable apparatus both for photography
and projection, others were endeavoring
to better the material for the film and improve
the photographic emulsion covering it.</p>

<p>There is no need in this book, in which we shall<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
try to explain the making of animated screen
drawings, to recount the whole story of the progressive
improvements of the machines used in
the motion-picture industry. But a short notice
of the present-day appliances will not be out
of place.</p>

<p>The three indispensable pieces of mechanism
are the camera, the projector, and the printer, or
apparatus that prints pictures photographically.
All three in certain parts of their construction<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
are similar in working principles. The mechanical
arrangements of the camera and projector especially
are so much alike that some of the first
apparatus fabricated were used both for photography
and projection. A few early types of
cameras served even for printers as well.</p>

<p>The essential details of the three machines
named above can be described briefly as follows:
(1) A camera has a light-tight compartment within
which a fresh strip of film passes and stops
intermittently back of a lens that is focussed on
a subject, a rotating shutter with an open and
an opaque section makes the exposure. (When
the strip of film is developed it is known as the
negative.) (2) A printer pulls the negative, together
with a fresh strip of film in contact with
it, into place by an intermittent mechanism before
a strong light. A rotating shutter flashes the
light on and off. (The new piece of film, when it
is developed and the pictures are brought out, is
known as the positive.) (3) The projector moves
the positive film by an intermittent mechanism
between a light and a lens; a rotating shutter,
with open and opaque sections, alternately shuts
the light off and on. When the light rays are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
allowed to pass the pictures contained on the
positive film are projected on the screen.</p>

<p>It seems unnecessary, perhaps, in these days
of the ubiquity of snap-shot cameras, and the
fact that nearly every one becomes acquainted
with their manipulation, to mention that a photographic
negative records the light and shade of
nature negatively, and that a positive print is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
one that gives a positive representation of such
light and shade.</p>

</figure>

<p>A motion-picture camera of the most approved
pattern is an exceedingly complicated and finely
adjusted instrument. Its principle of operation
can be understood easily if it is remembered that
it is practically a snap-shot camera with the addition
of a mechanism that turns a revolving
shutter and moves a length of film across the
exposure field, holds it there for an interval while
the photographic impression is made, and then
moves it away to continue the process until the
desired length of film has been taken. This
movement, driven by a hand-crank, is the same
as that of a projector—previously explained—namely,
an intermittent one.</p>

<p>This is effected in a variety of ways. The
method in many instruments is an alternate one
of the going back and forth of a pair of claw-levers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
that during one such motion draw the film into
place by engaging the claws into perforations on
the margins of the film.</p>

<p>The patterns of the shutters in camera and
projector differ. That of the projector is three
or two parted, as stated in our observations previously
made. A camera shutter is a disk with
an open section. The area of this open section
can be varied to fit the light conditions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span></p>

</figure>

<p>The general practice relative to taking motion-pictures
is to have one-half foot of film move
along for each turn of the camera handle. Eight
separate pictures are made on this one-half foot of
film. But in a camera that the animated cartoon
artist uses, but one turn of the handle for each
picture is the method. In most cameras the
gearing can be changed to operate either way.
To photograph drawings in making animated
films a good reliable instrument is necessary,
and requirements to the purpose should be
thought of in selecting one. One important
matter that may be mentioned here is that there
should be an easy way of focussing the scene.
Generally in taking topical pictures and views,
an outside finder and a graduated scale for distance
and other matters is made use of, but for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
drawings it is essential to be able to focus on a
suitable translucent surface within the exposure
field in the camera.</p>

<p>There are certain numerical formulas that
those going into motion-picture work should
learn at the start. It is well, too, for the general
reader, even if he is interested only as a matter
of information to take note of them. Their comprehension
will help to a better understanding
of how both the ordinary photographic film, and
the film from animated drawings, are made, prepared,
and shown on the screen.</p>

<p>As the ordinary phrase goes, any single subject
in film form is spoken of as a reel; but in
strict trade usage the word means a length of
one thousand feet. As it is generally reckoned,
sixty feet of film pass through the projecting machine
every minute. This means that a reel of
one thousand feet will take about seventeen minutes.
Now with sixty feet of film crossing the
path of light in one minute, we see that one
foot hurries across in one second. And as sixteen
little pictures are contained in one foot of film,
we get an idea of the great number of such
separate pictures in a reel of ordinary length.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
All these particulars—especially that regarding
the speed at which the film moves—are vital
matters for the animated cartoon artist to keep
in mind as he plans his work.</p>

<br>
<br>MAKING ANIMATED CARTOONS</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uc">In</span> the preceding chapter the attention was
called to the fact that a foot of film passes
through the projector in one second, and that in
each foot there are sixteen pictures, or frames,
within the outlines of which the photographic
images are found. When a camera man sets up
his apparatus before a scene and starts to operate
the mechanism, the general way is to have the
film move in the camera at this same rate of
speed; to wit, one foot per second. As each single
turn of the camera handle moves only one-half of
a foot of film, the camera man must turn the
handle twice in one second. And one of the
things that he must learn is to appraise time
durations so accurately that he will turn the
handle at this speed.</p>

<p>The animated cartoon artist, instead of using
real people, objects, or views to take on his film,
must make a number of related drawings, on every
one of which there must be a change in a proper,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
progressive, and graduated order. These drawings
are placed under a camera and photographed in
their sequence, the film developed and the resultant
negative used to make a positive film.
This is used, as we know, for screen projection.
All the technical and finishing processes are the
same whether they are employed in making the
usual reel in which people and scenes are used,
or animated cartoon reels from drawings.</p>

<p>When it is considered that there are in a half
reel (five hundred feet, the customary length for
a comic subject) exactly eight thousand pictures,
with every one—theoretically—different, it seems
like an appalling job to make that number of
separate drawings for such a half reel. But an
artist doesn’t make anywhere near as many
drawings as that for a reel of this length, and
of all the talents required by any one going
into this branch of art, none is so important as
that of the skill to plan the work so that the
lowest possible number of drawings need be made
for any particular scenario.</p>

<p>“Animator” is the special term applied to the
creative worker in this new branch of artistic
endeavor. Besides the essential qualification of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
bestowing life upon drawings, he must be a man
of many accomplishments. First as a scenario is
always written of any screen story no matter
whether serious, educational, or humorous, he
must have some notion of form; that is to say,
he must know what good composition means in
putting components together in an orderly and
proportional arrangement.</p>

<p>If the subject is an educational one he must
have a grasp of pedagogical principles, too, and
if it is of a humorous nature, his appreciation
of a comic situation must be keen.</p>

<p>And then with the terrifying prospect confronting
him of having to make innumerable drawings
and attending to other incidental artistic details
before his film is completed, he must be an untiring
and a courageous worker. His skill as a manager
comes in when planning the whole work in the
use of expedients and tricks, and an economy of
labor in getting as much action with the use of
as few drawings as possible.</p>

<p>Besides the chief animator, others, such as
assistant animators, tracers, and photographers,
are concerned in the production of an animated
film from drawings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span></p>

<p>Comments on the writing of the scenario we
do not need to go into now. Often the artist himself
writes it; but if he does not, he at least plans
it, or has a share in its construction.</p>

<p>Presuming, then, that the scenario has been
written, the chief animator first of all decides on
the portraiture of his characters. He will proceed
to make sketches of them as they look not
only in front and profile views, but also as they
appear from the back and in three-quarter views.
It is customary that these sketches—his models,
and really the <span lang="la">dramatis personæ</span>, be drawn of
the size they will have in the majority of the
scenes. After the characters have been created,
the next step is to lay out the scenes, in other
words, plan the surroundings or settings for each
of the different acts. The rectangular space of
his drawings within which the composition is
contained is about ten or eleven times larger than
the little three-quarter-by-one-inch pictures of the
films; namely, seven and one-half by ten inches,
or eight and one-quarter by eleven inches. For
some kinds of films—plain titles and “trick” titles—the
making of which will be remarked upon further
on—a larger field of about thirteen and one-half
by eighteen inches is used.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span></p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp60" id="i_061" >
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_061.png" alt="Glass fitted into rectangular 
opening in the board; The two registering pegs; Electric light">
  <figcaption class="caption">“ANIMATOR’S” DRAWING-BOARD.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Now with a huge pile of white linen paper cut
to a uniform size of about nine by twelve inches,
the animator apportions the work to the several
assistant animators. The most important scene
or action, of course, falls to his share. There are
several ways of going about making animated
cartoons, and trick titles, and these methods will
be touched upon subsequently. But in the particular
method of making animated cartoons
which we are describing now—that in which
paper is the principal surface upon which the
drawings are made in ink—all the workers make
their drawings over a board that has a middle
portion cut out and into which is fitted a sheet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
of thick glass. Under this glass is fixed an electric
light. On the board along the upper margin of
the glass, there is fixed to the wood a bar of iron
to which two pins or pegs are firmly fixed. These
pegs are a little less than one-half inch high and
distant from each other about five inches. It
doesn’t matter much what this distance is, excepting
this important point: all the boards in
any one studio must be provided with sets of pegs
that are uniform with respect to this distance
between them. And all of them should be most
accurately measured in their placing. Sometimes
as an expedient, pegs are merely driven into the
board at the required distance.</p>

<p>These pegs are seven thirty-seconds of an inch
in diameter. That the animator should use this
particular size of pegs was determined, no doubt,
by the fact that an article manufactured originally
for perforating pages and sheets used in certain
methods of bookkeeping was found available for
his purposes. This perforator cuts holes exactly
seven thirty-seconds of an inch in diameter.
Each one of the sheets of paper from the huge
pile spoken of above, before it is drawn upon, has
two holes punched into one of its long edges at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
the same distance apart as the distance between
the two pegs fixed to the animator’s drawing-board.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp70" id="i_063" >
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_063.png" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption">A SHEET OF PERFORATED PAPER AND THE REGISTERING
PEGS.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Fitting one of these sheets of paper over the
pegs, the artist-animator is ready for work. As
the paper lies flat over the glass set into the board,
he can see the glare of the electric light underneath.
This illumination from below is to enable
him to trace lines on a top sheet of paper from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
lines on a second sheet of paper underneath; and
also to make the slight variations in the several
drawings concerned in any action.</p>

<p>Now the reason for the pegs is this: as in an
ordinary motion-picture film certain characters,
as well as objects and other details are quiescent,
and only one or a few characters are in action,
so in an animated cartoon some of the figures,
or details, are quiescent for a time. And as they
stay for a length of time in the same place in the
scene, their portrayal in this same place throughout
the series of drawings is obtained by tracing
them from one sheet to another. The sheets are
held in place by the pegs and they insure
the registering of identical details throughout a
series.</p>

<p>When the animator designs his setting, the
stage scenery of any particular animated play,
he keeps in mind the area within which his figures
are going to move. Reasons for this will become
apparent as the technic of the art is further explained.
The outline of his scene, say a background,
simply drawn in ink on a sheet of paper
is fitted over the pegs. The light under the glass,
as explained immediately above, shows through<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
it. Next a fresh sheet of paper is placed over
the one with the scene, and as the paper is selected
for its transparent qualities, as well as its adaptability
for pen-drawing, the ink lines of the scene
underneath are visible.</p>

<p>Let us presume now, that the composition is to
represent two men standing and facing each other
and talking. They are to gesticulate and move
their lips slightly as if speaking. (In the following
description we will ignore this movement of
the mouth and have it assumed that the artist
is drawing this action, also, as he proceeds with
the work.) The two men are sketched in some
passive position, and the animation of one of
the figures is started. With the key sketch of
the men in the passive position placed over the
light, a sheet of paper is placed over it and the
extreme position of a gesticulating arm is drawn,
then on another sheet of paper placed over the
light the other extreme position of this arm action
is drawn. Now, with still another sheet of
paper placed over the others, the intermediate
position of the gesture is drawn. As the man
was standing on the same spot all the time his
feet would be the same in all the drawings and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
other parts of his figure would occupy the same
place. But the animator does not draw these
parts himself but marks the several sheets where
they occur with a number, or symbol, that will
be understood by one of his helpers—a tracer—as
instructions to trace them. The other man in
the picture, who all this time has been motionless,
is also represented in all the drawings line for
line as he was first drawn in the preliminary key
sketch. This again is a job for the tracer.</p>

<p>When the action of the second figure is made,
the drawing of the three phases of movement in
his arms is proceeded with in the same way, and
the first figure is repeated in his passive position
during the gesturing of the second man.</p>

<p>It can be seen from this way of working in the
division of labor between the animator and his
helper that the actual toil of repeating monotonous
details falls upon the tracer. The animator does
the first planning and that part of the subsequent
work requiring true artistic ability.</p>

<p>So that the artists can see to do the work described
above—tracing from one sheet of paper
to another and distinguishing ink lines through
two or more sheets of paper while they are over
the illuminated glass—the expedient is adopted
of shading the work-table from the glare of strong
daylight.</p>

<p class="hang1">ILLUSTRATING THE GREAT AMOUNT OF DRAWING REQUIRED
IN ANIMATING A SCENE WITHOUT THE HELP OF
TRANSPARENT CELLULOID.</p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
<p>In this typical process of depicting a simple
action, or animating a figure, as it is called, we
have left out specific explanations for drawing the
details of the scenery—trees, foreground, or whatever
is put into the composition as an accessory.
They go into a finished composition, to be sure.
One way would be to trace their outlines on each
and every sheet of paper. It is a feasible way
but not labor-saving. There is a much more
convenient way than that.</p>

<p>In beginning this exposition on animation it
was noted that the artist in designing the scenery
gave some thought to the area within which his
figures were placed, or were to act. He planned
when he did this, that no part of the components
of the scenery should interfere by crossing lines
with any portions of the figures. The reason for
this will be apparent when it is explained that
the scenery is drawn on a sheet of transparent
celluloid. Then when the celluloid with its scenery
is placed over one of the drawings it completes
the picture. The celluloid sheet has also two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
perforations that fit over the pegs, and it is by
their agency that its details are made to correspond
with the drawings on paper. And it can
further be understood that this single celluloid
sheet will complete, if it is designed properly, the
pictorial composition of every one of the drawings.
(A sheet of this substance that we are referring
to now is known in the craft as “a celluloid” or
shortened sometimes to “cell.”)</p>

<p>The employment of celluloid can be extended
to save other work in tracing parts of figures that
are in the same position, or that are not in action
throughout several drawings. In this case a second
celluloid will be used in conjunction with that
holding the scenery. To exemplify: In giving an
account of the drawing of the arm gestures in
the instance above, it was noted that an animator
drew the action only while he had a tracer complete
on all the drawings the parts that did not
move. Now, to save the monotony of all this,
the tracer takes celluloid and draws the similarly
placed quiet parts on it but once. This celluloid
is used during the photography with the several
action phases to complete the picture of the figure,
or figures.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span></p>

<p>A matter that the animator should guard
against, however, in having several celluloids
over his drawings, during the photography, is
that they will impart a yellowish tinge to his white
paper underneath if he uses more than two or
three. This would necessitate care in timing the
exposure correctly as a yellow tint has non-actinic
qualities that make its photography an uncertain
element.</p>

<p>The methods so far described of making drawings
for animated films are not complex and are
easy to manage. For effective animated scenes,
many more drawings are required and the adaptation
of celluloids is not always such an easy matter
as here described. For complete films of ordinary
length, the drawings, celluloids, and other items—expedients

USE OF THE EXPEDIENT OF DRAWING THE STILL
PARTS ON CELLULOID SHEETS.</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>

<p>We will use, however, our few drawings and
celluloids that we have completed to explain the
subsequent procedure in the making of animated
cartoons; namely, the photographic part of the
process.</p>

<p>A moving-picture camera is placed on a framework
of wood, or iron, so that it is supported over
a table top or some like piece of carpentry. It
is placed so that it faces downward with the lens
centred on the table. The camera is arranged
for a “one picture one turn of the crank” movement,
and a gearing of chain belts and pulleys,
to effect this, is attached to the camera and framework.
This gearing is put into motion by a turning-handle
close to where the photographer is
seated as he works before the table top where the
drawings are placed.</p>

<p>Each time the handle is turned but one picture,
or one-sixteenth of a foot of film, is moved into
the field back of the lens where the exposure is
made. The view or studio camera, as we know,
when a complete turn of the crank handle is made,
moves eight pictures, or one-half of a foot of film,
into position.</p>

<p>On the table directly under the lens and at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
the proper distance for correct focussing, a field
is marked out exactly that of the field that was
used in making the drawings. Two registering
pegs are also fastened relatively to the field as
those on all the drawing-boards in the studio.
Over the field, but hinged to the table top so that
it can be moved up and down, a frame holding
a clear sheet of glass is placed. The glass must
be fitted closely and firmly in the frame, as it is
intended to be pressed down on the drawings
while they are being photographed. Wood serves
the purpose very well for these frames. A metal
frame would seem to be the most practical, but
if there is in its <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;original text: constructon" id="constructon">construction</ins> the least inequality
of surface where glass and metal touch, the pressure
put upon the frame in holding the drawings
down is liable to crack the glass. With wood, as
there is a certain amount of give, this is not so
likely to happen.</p>

<p>Considering now that the camera has been
filled with a suitable length of blank film and
properly threaded in and out of the series of wheels
that feed it to the intermittent mechanism, and
then wind it up into its proper receptacle, we can
proceed with the photography.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span></p>

<p>The pioneers in the art who first tried to make
animated cartoons and similar film novelties attempted
the photography by daylight. Their
results were not very good, for they were much
handicapped by the uncertainty of the light.
Nowadays the Cooper Hewitt mercury vapor
light is used almost exclusively. The commonest
method of lighting is to fix a tube of this illuminant
on each side of the camera above the board,
but so placed that light rays do not go slantingly
into the lens, or are caught by any polished surface,
and so cause reflected lights that interfere
with the work. To get the exact position of the
light for an even illumination over the field means
a little preliminary experiment.</p>

<p>In looking over the material for our little film
we find that we have but a few drawings and
celluloids. Now, if we were to photograph them
and give each drawing one exposure—one picture,
or section on the film for each drawing—we
should get a length of film not even a foot long,
and the time on the screen not even lasting a
second, but an insignificant result for so much
work. Here at this stage of the work the able
animator must exercise his talents in getting as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
much film as possible, <i>i. e.</i>, “footage,” out of his
few drawings.</p>

GLASS.

<p class="subcap hang1">(For its position under the camera, see engraving on page <a href="#i_203">203</a>.) A perforated
sheet of paper holding a drawing is fitted over the pegs and the
frame lowered.</p>
</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>To begin: The first drawing in which the men
are quiescent is fitted over the pegs; but the picture
is not complete until the celluloid with the
scenery is also fitted over the pegs. When this
is put in place and the frame with the glass is
pressed down it is ready for photography. The
first figures will not begin to gesticulate immediately—no,
a certain time is necessary for the
audience to appreciate—have enter into their consciousness—that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
the picture on the screen represents
two men facing each other and about to
carry on a conversation. Therefore the drawing
showing the men motionless is photographed on
about two or three feet of film. This will give
on the screen just so many seconds—two or three—for
the mental grasping by the audience of
the particulars of the pictorial composition. Next
to show the first figure going through his movements
we lift the framed glass and take off the
celluloid with the scenery and the paper with the
two men motionless. Now we put down over
the pegs the sheet of paper with one of the extreme
positions of the moving arms, and then
as that is all there is on the paper we must, to
complete the portrayal, place over it the celluloid
with the rest of his figure. (This celluloid also
holds the complete drawing of the other individual
as he is motionless during the action of the first
one.) Next the entire composition is completed
by putting down the scenery celluloid. Then
when the framed glass is lowered and pressed
down so that everything presents an even surface,
the picture is photographed. After two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
turns of the handle—photographing it on two
sections of the film—the frame is raised and the
celluloids and the drawing are both taken off of
the pegs. The photographing of the second or
intermediate position is proceeded with in the
same way. After this the third or other extreme
phase of the action is photographed.</p>

<p>The photography is continued by taking the
intermediate phase again, then the first position,
then back to the intermediate one, and so on.
The idea is to give a gesticulating action to the
figure by using these three drawings back and
forth in their order as long as the story seems to
warrant it.</p>

<p>It is not to be forgotten that the celluloid with
the scenery is used every time the different action
phases are photographed.</p>

<p>The same procedure will be followed with the
celluloid and drawings of the other figure, only
before beginning his action a little extra footage
can be eked out by giving a slight dramatic pause
between the ending of the first man’s gesticulating
and the beginning of that of the other one.
By this is meant that the first scene with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
men motionless is taken on a short length of
film.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption">BALLOONS.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>In a little incident of this sort, dialogue, of
course, is required to help tell the point of the
story. This is effected by putting the wording
on a separate piece of paper—balloons, they are
called—for each case and placing it over the design
somewhere so that it will not cover any
important part of the composition. The necessary
amount of film for one of these balloons with
its lettering is determined by the number of seconds
that it takes the average spectator to read it. It
is by the interjection of these balloons with their
dialogue that an animator, in comic themes, can<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
get a considerable length of film from a very few
drawings.</p>

<p>After the photography is finished the exposed
film is taken out of the camera and sent to the
laboratory for development.</p>

<br>
<br>FURTHER DETAILS ON MAKING ANIMATED
CARTOONS</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uc">One</span> of the inspiriting things about this new
art of making drawings for animated cartoons
is that it affords such opportunities for a
versatile worker to exercise his talents. A true
artist delights in encountering new problems in
connection with his particular branch of work.
The very fact that he selects as his vocation some
art activity, rather than employment that is
mechanical, evinces this.</p>

<p>In making drawings for animated films and
in following the whole process of their making,
the artist will find plenty of scope for his ingenuity
in the devising of expedients to advance and finish
the work.</p>

<p>The first animated screen drawings were made
without the labor and time-saving resources of
the celluloid sheet. As has been explained, it
holds the still parts of a scene during the photography.
The employment of this celluloid is now<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
in common usage in the art. It is found an expedient
in various ways; sometimes to hold part
only of a pictorial composition as in the method
touched upon in the preceding chapter where
ink drawings are made on paper; or, again, in another
method to be used instead of paper, to hold
practically all of the picture elements. By this
latter method, in which a pigment is also put on
the transparent material, the projected screen
image is in graduated tones giving the appearance
of a monochrome drawing.</p>

<p>Animators sometimes are released from the
irksomeness of making the innumerable drawings
for certain cases of movement, as that of an object
crossing the picture field from one side to
the other, by using little separate drawings cut
out in silhouette.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="i_084f" >
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_084f.png" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption">CARDBOARD MODEL OF AN AIRPLANE WITH SEPARATE CUT-OUT PROPELLERS.

<p class="subcap center">The propellers are placed in position on the front of the airplane in their order continuously while the
model, under the camera, is moved across the sky.</p>

<p class="subcap center"><em>On the left</em>: Part of film made from the cut-out model.</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
It is an airplane, as an instance, we will say,
that is to fly across the sky. For this, the airplane
will be drawn but once on a piece of thin
cardboard, finished in light and shade and then
carefully cut out around its contour so that it
will be like a flattened model. This model, specifically
spoken of as a “cut-out,” is pushed over
the background under the camera and photographed.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
The manipulation of this airplane cut-out,
to a chance observer, would be thought of
as being child’s play. It is anything but that,
however, as infinite patience is required to move
it properly and have the distances between the
various positions evenly spaced. If, too, there
is a change of speed intended, the necessary ratio
of spacing and timing must be relatively proportionate.
Of course, it is understood that the airplane
cut-out is, after each move, photographed.
The distance that it is moved determines the
speed that will show on the screen. If, for example,
it is moved only one-sixteenth of an inch
each time, the movement will be very slow.</p>

<p>When an artist wishes to give a more natural
effect in a moving object in which a cut-out is
used, he makes some allowance for the laws of
perspective by making several cut-outs in which
the outlines defining the object observe these
laws to some extent.</p>

<p>It is to be remembered that an object looks
differently according to whether it is viewed on
an extreme side or in the centre of the field. To
be absolutely correct, there should be a separate
drawing for each position. To explain: Beginning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
with an extreme side position, the lines defining
the thickness go off somewhat obtusely to
the centre of vision; as the object moves and
nears the middle, these lines keep their direction
but change their angle. The direction is always
toward the centre of vision, and the angle, with
respect to a vertical, is always sharper. In the
very centre, the object, if it is on a level with
the eye, is in profile.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp80" id="i_086" >
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_086.png" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption">The laws of perspective are to be considered in “animating” an object
as it passes across the screen.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The entire matter is one of a different perspective
drawing for each position. In the movement
of the subject toward the other side a reverse
change takes place in the direction of the lines.
Generally only a few separate drawings—or cut-outs—are
needed to render the screen illusion
sufficiently resembling actuality to satisfy the eye.</p>

<p>There is a form of animated cartoon in which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
the objects, details of the view, and the figures
are in white on a black ground. Usually this kind
of film is of a comic subject. With the delineations
of the characters in a burlesque style and
the actions indubitably ludicrous, they provoke
a great deal of laughter. Such screen stories,
when the figures are well imagined and drawn in
an exaggerated way, and the other parts are conformably
incongruous and with a unity of ridiculousness
and absurdity in story and action, are to
be considered as true works of dramatic art.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp80" id="i_087" >
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_087.png" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption">The principles of perspective are applied in the drawing of birds as well
as in the picturing of objects.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The mode, generally, of making these strong
black-and-white effects is to have the figures and
moving parts of separate units to be arranged
under the camera in connection with a simple
scene drawn in white, or gray, on a black ground.
The figures of animals are made as dummies, with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
jointed limbs. This makes it possible to put them
into the various positions necessary for giving the
illusion of life as they are moved about over the
background.</p>

<p>These dummies are designed with but little
detail and are drawn on a carefully selected white
surfaced cardboard or thick paper that gives in
contrast with the background good white-and-black
negatives. The joinings of these figures or
animals, are made with the thinnest kind of
wire fashioned into tiny pivoting pins. Sometimes
in spite of the artist’s efforts to conceal
these wire pivots by placing them where a hooked
ink line indicates a fold of drapery, sharp-eyed
individuals can detect them on the screen. Where
such jointed dummies are used under the framed
glass, the wire pivots will not do. Instead, the
artist must find some way of fashioning cardboard
rivets, or washers, to join the parts of the
figures. A thin elastic tissue would do perhaps,
as an expedient, to clothe these little dummies and
hide the joinings of the cardboard segments.</p>

  <img class="w100" src="images/i_089.png" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption">ARTICULATED CARDBOARD FIGURES.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Here we may note the so-called “trick” titles
that are shown in theatres for special occasions,
or in connection with the regular films. They<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
add with their liveliness a little variety to the
tedium of a long presentation of monotonously
toned photographs. In them, the letters make
their appearance one at a time, and in most cases
they are white on a black ground. The production
of these titles with their letters that merrily
cut capers all over the background before they
come into their orthographic order is a very simple<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
manœuvre. The separate letters, cut out of cardboard,
are laid down to be photographed one at
a time as they spell the words. Where they are
first made to move about in an amusing manner,
they are similarly manipulated on the background
under the camera by being pushed about as desired
and photographed at each change of position.</p>

<p>The best background for these titles, when it is
to be solid black, is a piece of black velvet. This
material is a serviceable article in motion-picture
work as it gives an intense and certain black,
and if wrinkles form in it they do not betray
themselves by any lights or shadows in the photographic
print.</p>

<p>Sometimes in trick work it is intended that
some part of the design is masked while another
part is being photographed. This is a simple
matter if the background is a dark one, as a
piece of paper, or cardboard, of the same color
is placed over it while the photography is taking
place. A line of letters, for instance, that is already
drawn on the dark ground is to appear
letter by letter. A strip of this dark-colored paper
covers the words at first, but is pulled away to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
expose the letters one by one. Another way would
be to clip off a section of the paper bit by bit.
Blackening the edges of the paper will provide
against these edges showing as light lines and so
giving away the ruse.</p>

<p>In selecting for working under the camera of
dark-colored cardboards, it is advisable to pick
out only those with dead mat surfaces and reject
those with any enamelled or shiny surfaces.</p>

<p>As previously mentioned, for trick titles, a
larger field is used than that for animated cartoons.
It makes the manipulation of dummies
and detached items much more convenient.</p>

<p>An amazing and wonderful screen illusion is
that of animated sculpture. The audience first
sees a shapeless mass of clay which of itself seems
to assume in a few seconds a plastic composition.
It is a portrait of a notable, perhaps, or it may
take the form of a grotesque mask.</p>

<p>The trick of animated sculpture is produced
like this: A camera is centred on a rough mass of
clay, which is first photographed in this shapeless
form. A sculptor now pushes the clay around
to a desired preliminary effect, then when he has
stepped out of the picture, that is, gets out of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
the range of the lens, the clay is photographed
again. Once more the sculptor moulds the clay
to a stage approaching the contemplated form,
steps out of the picture and the camera brought
into action again.</p>

<p>The proceeding is continued: modelling the clay,
the sculptor getting out of the range of the lens,
and the camera brought into action, until the clay
has been fashioned in its complete form. The
interruptions during which the sculptor was working
will not be represented on the screen as the
camera was not working then, and so no exposures
were made. Instead, the effect will be a continuous
one of a mass of clay miraculously forming
itself into a plastic work.</p>

<p>The way of working in making animated sculpture,
like that of the process of using dummies
that are moved, little by little, while the shutter
is closed and then photographed after each time
that they have been moved, is called the “stop-motion”
method. The motion of the camera is
stopped, in other words, while the particular object
is placed in a new position each time before
it is photographed.</p>

<p>When on the screen you see some thin black<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
line appearing on one side, crawling reptilian
fashion, suddenly turning upward, twisting and
soon beginning to outline the silhouette of a figure
or part of a pictorial composition, there is exemplified
another instance of this “stop-motion”
photography.</p>

<p>This extraordinary performance of a plain line,
to the average spectator seems wondrous, and
its production a veritable mystery. But it is
managed very easily.</p>

<p>For news picture reels it has been found
judicious for variety’s sake, as well as for business
reasons, to combine with them cartoons satirizing
topics of the hour. When they are wanted, they
are wanted in a hurry, and as the regular type
of cartoon takes not a little time to make, the
living line drawings adverted to above, as they
are quickly made, are often used for the purpose.
We shall try to give in the following few paragraphs
an elucidation of the method of making
a film like this.</p>

<p>The general idea or composition of the drawing
is sketched out first on a piece of ordinary paper,
then its outlines are traced in blue markings to a
sheet of Bristol board that has been fastened down<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
to the table beneath the camera within the photographic
field. Light-blue marks do not take on
the ordinary sensitized film. But the blue markings,
it is to be remembered, must be of the faintest.
The very cautious artist in beginning a work of
this sort makes a preliminary test of his blue
pencilling by photographing a short length of film
and developing it to see if the marks show on
the negative. If they show at all, it will be necessary
to take a soft eraser and go over the drawing
and make the blue marks less distinct, and only
have them show enough to be able to follow the
drawing in executing the pen work.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp70" id="i_095" >
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_095.png" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption">ILLUSTRATING THE ANIMATION OF A MOUSE AS HE RUNS
AROUND THE KITCHEN AND FRIGHTENS THE COOK.<br>

The general scene is drawn on celluloid, while fifty or more sheets of paper
hold a sequence of pictures of the mouse in attitudes of running.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>When quite sure that the blue marks will not
photograph, the artist begins his drawing. It is
not a difficult task that he has before him—he
merely inks his previously drawn lines little by
little. Each stroke of the pen, after it has been
made, is photographed. If the ink lines are short
the movement on the screen will be very slow,
and if they are long the movement will be very
rapid. And, again, whether the artist turns the
camera handle once, twice, or three times for each
pen stroke has its effect upon the speed with
which the lines grow on the screen. If somewhat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
long pen strokes are made and the exposure is but
one picture for each stroke the lines will run in
and finish the design at a rapid rate. On the
other hand, if they are very short strokes and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
three pictures (about one-fifth of a foot of film)
are given to each one, the lines will creep in on
the screen at a snail’s pace.</p>

<p>All this, making a line, a patch of tinting, a
small detail of a picture, and photographing each
item after it has been made, is continued until
the entire pictorial design is completed.</p>

<p>Variety is produced by having the lines go
slowly or fast according to the requirements of
the idea to be expressed or the story to be told.</p>

<br>
<br>ON MOVEMENT IN THE HUMAN FIGURE</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uc">Having</span> now chronicled in a brief way the
development of the cinematographic art,
particularly in its relation to animated screen
drawings, and having tried to give some notion
of the fundamentals in their making with an account
of their exhibition on the screen, it is in
order now that we consider the matter of movement
and its depiction by drawings that will give
the visional synthesis of life.</p>

<p>The very first thing that a tyro in the animating
art must learn is to draw a walk; or in other
words, to become skilled in sketching the successive
phases of limb and trunk movements so that
they give in their order the appearance of walking
when projected as a film.</p>

<p>Walking directly effected by the lower limbs
calls into action the upper limbs too. The upper
limbs act, as they swing from the shoulders, in
concord with the legs, as counterpoises in maintaining<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
the equilibrium. An understanding of
the principles underlying locomotion in man—walking
or running—is an important matter to
consider in this art. When an artist knows the
basic facts of movement in the human figure, he
will more readily comprehend animal locomotion
and all other movements in general.</p>

<p>All forms of motion are pertinent as studies
for the animator, and the all-important study is
that of the human organism.</p>

<p>Although we observe at once, in considering
a simple walking movement, that there is also
a simultaneous activity of the arms accompanied
by a harmony of exertion in the trunk, we will
at the start dwell mainly upon the phases of action
in the legs only.</p>

<p>Imagine now that the figure that is to serve
us as a model is walking. The trunk in the air,
some thirty inches above the ground, is moving
forward. Attached to it are the nether limbs,
alternately swinging pendently and alternately
supporting the trunk in its position above the
ground.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span></p>
<figure class="figcenter illowp90" id="i_101" >
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_101.png" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption">SUCCESSIVE PHASES OF MOVEMENTS OF THE LEGS IN WALKING.

<p class="subcap center">Above: Diagram to indicate the length of a stride and to show how the head describes a “wave.”</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Further to simplify our study, we will, at first,
consider the mechanism of one limb only. As<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
one foot swings forward and reaches a certain
place, it seems to hesitate for an instant and then
come down, heel first, on the ground. As the heel
strikes, the body is slightly jarred and the oblique
line of the limb, its axis, moves and approaches
the vertical. In a moment, the limb is vertical
as <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;original text: its" id="its">it</ins> supports the trunk and the sole of the foot
bears on the ground. Then the axis of the leg
changes its verticality and leans forward, carrying
with it the body. Soon the heel leaves the ground
and only the fore part of the foot—the region
of the toes—remains on the ground. But before
the foot is entirely lifted from the ground, there
is a slight pause, almost immeasurable, coming
immediately before the foot gives a push, leaves
the ground, and projects the body forward.</p>

<p>During the time of the phases of movement
described above, the foot, in a sort of way, rolls
over the ground from heel to toes.</p>

<p>Immediately after the toes leave the ground,
the knee bends slightly and the limb swings pendulum-like
forward, then, as it nears the point
directly under the centre of the trunk, it bends
a little more and lifts the foot to clear the
ground. After the limb has passed this central<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
point under the trunk and is beginning to advance,
it straightens out ready to plant its heel
on the ground again. When it has done so it
has completed the step, and the limb repeats
the series of movement phases again for the next
step.</p>

<p>Now, the limb of the other side has gone
through the same movements, too, but the corresponding
phases occurred alternately in point
of time.</p>

forward, is rarely represented by the graphic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
artist in his pictures. The aspect of the limbs
when they are at their extremes—spread out—one
forward and one to the back, is his usual
pictorial symbol for walking. But the position,
immediately noted above, is an important phase
of movement, as it is during its continuance that
the other limb is supporting the trunk.</p>

<p>A movement of the trunk in walking that is
to be remarked is its turning from side to side
as it swings in unison with the upper limbs while
they alternately swing forward and backward. It
is a movement that animators do not always
regard, since only an accomplished figure draftsman
can imagine movement clearly enough to
reproduce it. To describe the movement better
we will consider it visionally.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption">SUCCESSIVE PHASES OF MOVEMENTS IN WALKING, ILLUSTRATING ESPECIALLY THE
RECIPROCAL ACTION OF THE LIMBS.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>We are looking at the walker from the side
and see the trunk in profile—exactly in profile,
of course, when the arms are at the middle position.
As the near-side arm moves forward we
see a slight three-quarter back view of the upper
part of the trunk, then when the arm swings back
we see the profile again, and with the arm moving
still farther back, the corresponding side of the
shoulder moves with it and the upper part of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
the trunk is seen in three-quarter front view.
If the artist shows, in a walk, these particulars:
(1) A three-quarter view from the front; (2) profile;
(3) a three-quarter view from the back, and
then carries them back and forth, he will add to
the effectiveness of the screen representation. It
gives to a figure, when slightly exaggerated in a
humorous picture, a very laughable swaggering
gait.</p>

<p>The arms were mentioned as swinging in a
walk so as to help maintain the equilibrium. It
will not be difficult to understand the phases
through which they go if it is remembered that an
arm moves in unison with the lower limb of the
opposite side. This can be observed if one looks
from an upper window down on the passers-by.
It will then be noted how one arm as it hinges
and oscillates from the shoulder-joint, follows
the lower limb of the opposite side as it hinges
and swings from the hip-joint.</p>

<p class="subcap center">Four phases complete a step.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Contemplating the arms only, it will be perceived
that they keep up a constant alternate
swinging back and forth. The point where they
pass each other will be when they both have approached
their respective sides of the trunk. This<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
particular moment when the arms are opposite
one another and close to the trunk, or at least
near the vertical line of the body, is coincident
with the phases of the lower limb movements
when one is nearly rigid as it supports the body
and the other is at its median phase of the
swinging movement.</p>

<p>These middle positions of the four limbs—the
lower near to each other, and the upper close to
the body—is a characteristic that should be taken
note of by the artist. It illustrates, in connection
with the extreme positions, certain peculiarities
of motion in living things, in general. This is a
sort of opening movement following by a closing
one. These reciprocal changes, expansion and
retraction in organic forms, symbolize the activity
of life.</p>

<p>In the human body, for instance, during action,
there are certain times when the limbs are
close to the trunk and at other times when they
are stretched out or extended. This is adequately
made plain in jumping. Specifically: in the preliminary
position before the actual jump, the
appendicular members bend and lie close to the
trunk. The entire body is compact and repressed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
like a spring. Then when the jump takes place,
there is a sudden opening as the limbs fling themselves
outward.</p>

<p>A rower in a shell plying his sculls exemplifies
this phenomenon of a spring-like closing and
expansion. In this case there is also a typical
example of reciprocal compensating movements
in the two pairs of limbs. When the rower leans
forward and the arms are extended ready to pull
on his sculls, the lower limbs are flexed and in
contact with the front of his trunk. Then when
the sculls have been pulled back and he has reached
the other extreme position, the arms are flexed
and close to his chest, while the lower limbs are
stretched out straight.</p>

<p>If the animator is planning to walk a figure<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
across the field of the screen, there is one matter
in the representation that he punctiliously takes
heed of. It is this: to have the trunk rise as it
is in turn supported upon one rigid leg and then
upon the other, and to show that it falls slightly
when the two limbs are outstretched at their
extreme positions. In this alternating rise and
fall of the trunk in walking, the head can be observed
as describing a wave. The highest point
of the wave is when the trunk is supported on
the rigid leg and the lowest point when both limbs
are stretched out as if flying from the vertical
of the body.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption">ORDER IN WHICH AN ANIMATOR MAKES THE SEQUENCE OF
POSITIONS FOR A WALK.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>In scheming out the positions for a walk, the
artist first draws one of the extreme outstretched
positions (<i>A</i>). (It is supposed that we are drawing
a figure that is going from left to right.) Then
on another sheet of paper the following outstretched
position (<i>B</i>), but placed one step in
advance. These drawings are now placed over
the tracing glass of the drawing-board. All the
following drawings of this walk are to be traced
over this glass, and they will be kept in register<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
by the two pegs in the board. As now placed,
the two drawings (<i>A</i> and <i>B</i>) cover the distance
of two steps. A foot that is about to fall on the
ground and one that is about to leave it meet
at a central point. Here a mark is made to indicate
a footprint. A similar mark for a footprint
is made on each side to indicate the limits
of the two steps.</p>

</figcaption>
</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span></p>
<p>A sheet of paper is next placed over the two
drawings (<i>A</i> and <i>B</i>), and on the central footprint
the middle position (<i>C</i>) of the legs is drawn. In
this the right limb is nearly straight and supporting
the body, while the other limb, the left, is bent
at the knee and has the foot raised to clear the
ground. The next stage will be to make the first
in-between position (<i>D</i>) between the first extreme
and the middle position. It is made on a fresh
sheet of paper placed over those containing the
positions just mentioned. The attitude of the right
limb in this new position would be that in which
it is about to plant its foot on the ground and the
left limb is depicted as if ready to swing into the
position that it has in the middle one (<i>C</i>).</p>


<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>

<p>Then with the middle position (<i>C</i>) and the
last extreme one (<i>B</i>) over the glass, on another
sheet of paper, the next in-between one (<i>E</i>) is
drawn. This shows the right foot leaving the
ground and the left leg somewhat forward ready
to plant its heel on the ground. We have now
secured five phases or positions of a walking movement.</p>

<p>The two extremes (<i>A</i> and <i>B</i>) spoken of as the
outstretched ones have the same contours but
differ in that in one the right limb is forward, and
the left is directed obliquely backward, while
in the other it is the left limb that projects forward
and the right has an obliquity backward.</p>

<p>Now, if we make tracings, copying the outlines
only, of the three other positions (<i>C</i>, <i>D</i>, and <i>E</i>),
but reversing the particular aspects of the right
and the left limbs, we shall have obtained enough
drawings to complete two steps of a walk.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption">PHASES OF MOVEMENT OF A WALK.

<p class="subcap center">Six phases complete a step.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>As a better understanding of the preceding the
fact should be grasped that while one limb, the
right we will say, is assuming a certain position
during a step, in the next step it is the turn of the
other limb, the left, to assume this particular position.
And again in this second step, the right limb
takes the corresponding position that the other
limb had in the first step. There are always, in a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
walk, two sets of drawings, used alternately. Any
particular silhouette in one set has its identical silhouette
in the other set, but the attitudes of the
limbs are reversed. To explain by an example:
In the drawing of one middle position, the right
leg supports the body and the left is flexed, in
its coincidental drawing, it is the left that supports
the body and the right is flexed. (See 2
and 3+, of engraving on page <a href="#i_113">113</a>.)</p>

<p>From this it can be seen that the two sets of
drawings differ only in the details within their
general contours. These details will be such markings
as drapery folds, stripes on trousers, indications
of the right and the left foot by little items
like buttons on boots. Heeding and taking the
trouble to mark little details like these add to the
value of a screen image.</p>

<p>One of the most difficult actions to depict in
this art is that which the animator calls a perspective
walk. By this term he means a walk in
which the figure is either coming diagonally, more
or less, toward the front of the picture or going
away from it toward the horizon. It is obvious
that according to the rules of perspective,
in coming forward the figure gets larger and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
larger, and in travelling in the opposite direction
it gets smaller and smaller. To do this successfully
is not easy. Only after a worker has had
a great deal of experience in the art is he able
to draw such a movement easily.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp90" id="i_117" >
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_117.png" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption">A PERSPECTIVE WALK.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The constant changing sizes of the figures and
getting them within the perspective lines in a
graduated series are perplexing enough matters.
But this is not all. There is the problem of the
foreshortened views as the limbs are beheld perspectively.
Imagine, for instance, an arm pointing
toward the spectator in a foreshortened view.
Every artist would have his own individual way
of drawing this. Those with a natural feeling
for form and understanding anatomy solve problems
of this kind by methods for which it is impossible
to give any recipe. Some would start<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
with preliminary construction lines that have
the appearance of columnar solids in perspective,
while others scribble and fumble around until
they find the outlines that they want.</p>

<p>Happily in most of the occasions when a perspective
walk is required in a story it is for some
humorous incident. This signifies that it can be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
made into a speedy action, and that but a few
drawings are needed to complete a step.</p>

<p>Artists when they begin to make drawings for
screen pictures find a new interest in studying
movement. In the study of art the student gives
some attention, of course, to this question of movement.
Usually, though, the study is not discriminating,
nor thorough. But to become skilled
in animating involves a thoughtful and analytic
inquiry into the subject. If the artist is a real
student of the subject its consideration will be
more engrossing than the more or less slight study
given to the planning of the single isolated phases,
or attitudes, of action in ordinary pictorial work.</p>

<p>A great help in comprehending the nature of
movement and grasping the character of the attitudes
of active figures are the so-called “analysis
of motion” screen pictures. In these the model,
generally a muscular person going through the
motions of some gymnastic or athletic activity,
is shown moving very much slower than the
movement is in actuality. This is effected by
taking the pictures with a camera so constructed
that it moves its mechanism many times
faster than the normal speed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span></p>

<p>The speed of the ordinary camera, as we know,
moves during every second but one foot of film
and on which sixteen separate photographs are
made. Now, in one type of camera for analysis
of motion photography, eight times more film is
moved with a corresponding increase in the number
of separate pictures taken on it during this
same time of one second. To take a specific movement
of a model lasting one second: the ordinary
camera catches sixteen phases of it, but the extra-rapid
camera takes about one hundred and
twenty-eight separate pictures of as many corresponding
separate phases. In other words, the
ordinary camera takes about as much as our eyes
appreciate, while the fast camera records on a
length of film many more attitudes during the
course of the given activity than the unaided eye
can ever hope to see. When this long film of the
extra-rapid camera is run through the projecting
machine at the normal speed it shows us on
the screen, in a period of eight seconds, that which
took place in reality in but one second.</p>

<p>The animated drawing artist becomes, through
the training of his eye to quick observation and
the studying of films of the nature immediately<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
noted above, an expert in depicting the varied
and connected attitudes of figures in action. Examples
for study on account of the clear-cut
definitions of the actions, are the acrobats with
their tumbling and the clowns with their antics.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
Then in the performances of the jugglers and in
the pranks of the knock-about comedians, the
animator finds much to spur him on to creative
imagery. The pictorial artist for graphic or easel
work, in any of these cases, intending to make
an illustration, is content with some representative
position that he can grasp visually, or, which is
more likely to be the case, the one that is easiest
for him to draw. But the animator must have
sharp and quickly observing eyes and be able<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
to comprehend and remember the whole series
of phases of a movement.</p>

</figure>

<p>A fancy dancer, especially, is a rich study. To
follow the dancer with his supple joints bending<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
so easily and assuming unexpected poses of body
and limbs, requires attentive eyes and a lively
mental photography. The limbs do not seem to
bend merely at the articulations and there seems
to be a most unnatural twisting of arms, lower
limbs, and trunk. But it is all natural. It simply
means that there is co-ordination of movement
in all parts of the jointed skeletal frame.
This co-ordination—and reciprocal action—follows
definite laws of motion, and it is the business of
the animator to grasp their signification. It is,
in the main, the matter already spoken of above;
namely, the alternate action of flexion or a closing,
and that of extension or an opening.</p>

<p>With these characteristics there is also observable
in the generality of dancing posturing a tendency
of an upper limb to follow a lower limb
of the opposite side as in the cases of walking
and running.</p>

<p>Very strongly is this to be noticed in the
nimbleness of an eccentric dancer as he cuts
bizarre figures and falls into exaggerated poses.
For instance, when a lower limb swings in any
particular direction, the opposite arm oscillates
in the same direction and brings its hand close<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
enough to touch this concurrently swinging lower
limb.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption">PHASES OF MOVEMENT FOR A QUICK WALK.</figcaption>

<p>This symbolical phenomenon of the activity
of living things—the negative quality of a closing
or flexion, and the positive one of an opening or
extension—is not a feature entirely confined to
human beings and animals, but is a characteristic
showing in the mechanics of many non-living
things.</p>

<br>NOTES ON ANIMAL LOCOMOTION</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uc">In</span> the usual manner of locomotory progress in
the four-footed beasts, with but a few exceptions,
the actions of the limbs with respect to
the reciprocal movement of the two pairs, is the
same as that of man. When, for instance, a fore
limb moves, corresponding to the human arm, the
diagonally opposite hind limb, corresponding to
the human lower limb, moves also.</p>

<p>To explain this matter, again, we shall find it
helpful to give a somewhat humorous, but at
the same time a very practical example. An artist
intends to draw the picture of a man crawling
on his hands and knees. Before beginning to
work, the artist will visualize the movement if
he can, if not, try it by personal experiment.
Then he will see that when the right hand, we
will say, is lifted to go forward, immediately the
left knee leaves the floor and the two limbs—the
right arm and the left leg—advance at the same
time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span></p>

<p>On the completion of this advancing action,
the hand and the knee touch the floor nearly at
the same instant. (Exactly, though, the hand
is carried forward more rapidly and anticipates
the knee in reaching the floor.) After this action,
which has just been described, is concluded, it is
the turn of the other arm and leg to go through
the same movements. This is the manner, in a
general way, that the four-footed animals walk,
successively moving together the diagonally opposite
limbs.</p>

<p>An understanding of this locomotory principle—the
reciprocal actions of the two pairs of limbs—in
the generality of quadrupeds, will help an artist
to animate the various types of animals that he
will from time to time wish to put into his cartoons.
Naturally, they will be in most cases
combined with a comical screen story. Their
depiction, then, can be represented in a humorous
way and the artist merely needs to show in his
drawings the essentials of animal locomotion.</p>

<p>Instantaneous photographs of moving animals,
especially those of Muybridge, are helpful in
studying the movements of the dumb creatures.
The mindful examination of such photographs<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
gives hints as to the particular phases of movement
adaptable to animation.</p>

<p>Besides photographs, an ingenious auxiliary,
as a help in study, would be a little cardboard
jointed model of an animal. Say it is one to represent
a horse, it can be employed by moving
the limbs about in their order as they successively
make the steps while the artist selects from a
series of photographs a cycle of positions for a
movement. In making a jointed cut-out model,
however, and fastening the limbs by pivoting
pins, it is well to remember that the model can
be approximate only. Take the fore limbs, for
instance. In your model you will probably fasten
them to the trunk at some fixed place. That is
not the way that they are joined in the bony framework.
The joining of the fore limbs is not by a
hard articulation as in the arms of man which
are joined, through the intermediary collar-bone,
to the breast-bone. In the horse and in quadrupeds,
generally, the joining to the main bulk
of the body is by soft tissues. That is, by layers
and bands of muscle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span></p>

<p>In studying the actions of animals it will be
observed, especially in the antelope and deer
kind, that in leaping they land on their forefeet.
Any hard articulations of the fore limbs with the
rest of the skeleton could not submit to the shock
of these landings. When they land, it is the soft
yielding and elastic muscular parts of the shoulders
and adjacent regions that absorb the force of the
jolts.</p>

<p>The characteristic of life activity, flexion and
extension, is exemplified clearly in the actions of
an animal’s hind limbs as they double up in the
preparation for a leap; and then suddenly spread
out during the first part of the leap.</p>

<p>Taking it as a whole, in fleet-footed animals,
the function of the hind limbs is to furnish the
forward propelling force while that of the fore
limbs is to land on the ground at an advanced
position. This observation, of course, applies to
certain rapid methods of progression, and it will
do as a general statement only, as it has been
shown by photographs that the fore limbs have
a share in giving an impulse in locomotion. For
example, photographs of the horse in action show
the quick springing action of the fetlock and the
pastern joints as they bend in the hoof’s impact,
and its subsequent extension when the foot leaves
the ground.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span></p>

<p>In a rapid walk of a horse a phase of movement
that is apprehended by the eye is the lifting
of a forefoot and then the immediate impact of
the hind limb of the same side as it nearly falls
into the impression left by the fore foot. There
are speeds in which the footprints coincide. In
a more rapid pace than a walk, the imprint of
the hind foot is farther forward than that of the
forefoot. As the speed increases the stride
lengthens and the footprints are much farther
in advance.</p>

<p>In a certain type of humorous animation—the
panorama—to be explained in a succeeding chapter,
the artist is quite satisfied with his animation
of a quadruped if a lively bewildering effect of
agitated limbs is produced on the screen. This
bewildering blur has after all a resemblance to
that which the eye sees in rapidly running animals;
namely, a confused disturbance of limbs.
This effect on the screen always causes laughter
and the artist considers that as a proof of the
success of his work.</p>

<p>To produce this effect, the animator selects
from his studies three or five consecutive positions
of a gallop, or trot, that will animate well. This
means, specifically, that any particular drawing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
should, with the next in order, give an appearance
of movement when they are synthesized.
The drawings are made in a cycle so that when
used continuously in their order they will give
the illusion desired.</p>

<p>In a panorama it is not necessary to trouble
about a matter that in other forms of screen representation
of locomotion are highly important.
This is to have the feet register, by which is
meant that in any several succeeding drawings<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
where a foot is represented as touching, bearing
down, and leaving the ground, it should do all
this on a footprint that coincides in all of the
series. Tracing over the illuminated glass, while
making the drawings, is the only way to get footprints
accurately placed.</p>

as natural
to quadrupeds.
In the giraffe, the

at the same time
and in the same

camel is also noted
as going this way,
and the elephant
has a pace that
seems to be a

walking.</p>

<p>Now and then
the animator has
as one of his characters<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
a walking bird;
an ungainly ostrich is
a good example, or a
droll duck, perhaps.
Here he will have
plenty of scope in
applying his skill as a
humorous draftsman.
A nodding of the
head and a bobbing
of the body from side
to side in the duck,
and in the case of the
ostrich a wiggling of
the neck, are appropriate
adjuncts to
such animation.</p>

<p>In the walking
movement of a bird
the method of getting
the different
phases will be the
same as that of planning
a walk for the
human figure. Particularly,
too, must<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
the artist observe in the bird’s walk, the middle
phases in which one leg crosses the vertical of
the body to go forward for the implanting of its
foot upon the ground.</p>

<p>With respect to the study of wing movement
in flying birds, it is interesting to note that the
Japanese artist apprehended the various positions
that wings took in flying before the fact was
demonstrated by photography. The Occidental
artist, before the days of the instantaneous snap-shot
camera, had but one or two stereotyped positions
for picturing flying birds. Generally one
of these positions had the wings pointing upward,
and another with them outspread, more or less,
horizontally. But the Japanese artist anticipated
the snap-shot picture; he often had his
flying birds with the wings drawn below the
level of the bird’s body and pointing downward.</p>

<p>One good way, if an animator wishes to represent
a bird flying across the sky, is to have
several—five or seven—positions for the action
drawn on cardboard and then cut out. These
little bird models are placed, one at a time, over
the general scene during the photography and
manipulated in the same way as described for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>other cut-out models. The slight wavering from
the direct line of the bird’s flight that may occur
by this cut-out method would not matter very
much. The bird describes a wavering line anyway
as he flies—its body dropping slightly when
the wings go up and a correlative rise occurring
when the wing flap takes place.</p>

<p>If an artist wishes scrupulously to be exact
in drawing a bird flying across the sky, he should
observe certain rules of perspective applying to
the case. The problem is the same as that of
the airplane, previously noted, which flew across
the field of the picture. Regarding this matter,
to specify: When the bird appears on one side<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
it is represented in a side view, which changes as
it gets near the centre to a profile. After it has
been viewed in profile, the perspective changes
again and when it reaches the other side it is again
in a perspective side view, slightly from the back.</p>

<p>In the mode of progression that was given as
the usual one in quadrupeds, in which a diagonally
opposite fore and hind limb moved simultaneously,
there is a sinuous lateral twisting of the back-bone.
It is not so perceptible to us in the larger beasts.
It is an effect, though, that takes place in other
creatures and in some of them can be clearly seen.
In the walk of the lizard, as an instance, when
viewed from above, a successive undulation of
the back-bone takes place. As one fore limb—the
right, to particularize—moves forward, that
side of his body—the right shoulder, moves forward,
too; while approximately at the same time
the left hind limb moves forward and carries with
it that side or the left pelvic regions. This causes
an alternating obliquity of the transverse axes
of the shoulder and the hind regions of the body
of the reptile as he walks on the ground. And
this alternate changing of these axes gives rise
to a continuing sinuosity in the spine.</p>

<p>The mode of progression in legless creatures
is distinguished, too, by a lateral bending in and
out. Snakes and eels, for example, as they proceed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
agitate their bodies in wave-like motions.
The waves pass from the head to the tail, the
fluctuations taking the form of rather large loop-like
wrigglings of the elongated body. A spring-like
coiling up and then an expanding—flexion
and extension again—is the principle of the locomotory
manœuvre in the snake.</p>

<br>INANIMATE THINGS IN MOVEMENT</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uc">There</span> is very little effect of motion on the
screen of a moving straight line by itself
without any contrasting elements. Or, as the
moving-picture draftsman would say, it does not
animate well.</p>

<p>Now supposing a picture is intended of a man
tugging at a rope. He pulls hard and the rope
is taut and it appears practically straight. The
animation of the arms shows that they are moving
and give a good illusion of the tugging, but the
rope shows no movement on account of its rectilinearity.
It will be only when the artist gives
the rope a little undulating—or even a snake-like—motion
now and then that he can give the
effect of any disturbance in it. This sort of
thing, a slight shaking or a wavering of the line,
would do for ordinary cases but it would be better
if the artist showed a loose strand of cordage
fibre creeping along in the direction that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>
rope is supposed to be going. But still better
would it be to have a few kinks forming in
the rope and showing them agitated as they
go in the direction of the pull on the rope. In
producing this latter illusion the likely expedient
that the skilled animator would use is that of
having a set of celluloids with drawings—three
or five—showing the kink represented in a number
of progressive positions. The plan would be to
have the details in a cycle, so that when the last
detail of the cycle is photographed, the first one
exactly follows in a proper order. The artist
can put these rope drawings on the same sheets
of paper that hold the arm movements—we have
in mind the picture of the man tugging at the
rope, of course. Then the cycle of drawings with
the arm movements and the kinks of the rope
in their progressive order can be used over and
over again as long as it seems consistent with
good judgment.</p>

<p>This idea of arranging things in cycles is the general
way of animating inanimate things. Nearly
all the technical items in this chapter are managed
with some such plan. Generally, too, the
details are drawn on the transparent celluloids.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span></p>

<p>The problem in devising the components of
any cycle is to have these components so arranged
that the orderly movements take place from the
first of the series to the last and then begin with
the first again. The action must not skip, cause
a hesitation, or go backward. This simply means
that the components are to be spaced properly
with respect to their relations to each other.</p>

<p>It would be difficult to give by words any
directions exactly how to do this; actual drawing,
with a testing in the preliminary sketches is
the surest way of accomplishing it. As general
directions, however, the advice would be to have
an odd number of drawings and to vary the spatial
intervals between the separate items. They should
not, above all things, be equidistant.</p>

<p>Where the artist wishes to present to the spectator
an animated drawing of a waving banner,
or flag, he makes a cycle of different drawings.
If it is a flag, these drawings are made with undulating
folds that pass the length of the flag
as if it were agitated by the wind. Almost any
sort of rippling effect, necessitating but three
slightly different drawings, will satisfy the average
audience. But if the artist wishes to do conscientious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
work, he will give a little more attention
to his planning and try to make it nearer
actuality. Then he will contrive that there
be one dominant drapery fold which is carried
out farther and farther along the ruffled flag.
As this fold nears the end it lessens its volume
and at last disappears in a sudden flap. This
will take five or seven drawings. In planning
the cycle it will be arranged that immediately
before the last flapping, the first phase of the
dominant fold begins again.</p>

<p>This effect of ruffling drapery by a fixed set of
cycles used always in the same order will, of course,
give a monotonous waving. But it can be diversified
by an occasional break in the order in which
the separate elements of the cycle are photographed,
or an added modification obtained by
a supplemental large flapping fold which can be
produced by one extra drawing.</p>

<p>An ordinary fragment of drapery in a garment
is easily animated by making it in three phases.
This will give a satisfactory quivering motion
when projected in any bit of drapery that is blown
about or flutters on a figure in action.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span></p>

</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span></p>

<p>Flowing water, waves, and rippling on the
surface of a stream, are not difficult matters to
animate if the artist keeps in mind that the plainest
unelaborated line work gives for these elusive pictorial
ingredients the most striking effects on
the screen.</p>

<p>It is customary, again, for artistic particulars
like these to be made in cycles of three or five
drawings. The action for this class of subjects
is nearly always quick, and so drawings for the
purpose need not be numerous.</p>

<p>A water-splash is a detail of a screen animation
rather frequently introduced. Animators have
adopted a stereotyped way of rendering it. When
it is associated with a falling of some unlucky
character into the water, it is very effective from
a pictorial and a humorous point of view. The
succeeding up-rushing column of water, after the
splash, is made in the form of a huge mushroom—rather
conventional but extremely comical.</p>

<p>In such a particular as a jet of water, a cycle
of drawings is also used. In planning such drawings
for animation care must be taken that they
give in the combined screen illusion a proper one
of falling water. The slightest misplacing of succeeding
details representing the jet may give an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
effect of the water going backward. A funny
touch is what is wanted in a humorous picture,
but, generally, not of this sort.</p>

<p>Imparting an appearance of rain over a scene
is produced by having several celluloids with
lines indicating this. They would be used in their
order as designed during the photography in the
usual way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span></p>

<p>Falling snow—that indispensable ingredient of
the provincial melodrama—is simply managed
by spreading, at haphazard over several celluloids,
spots of white pigment. A general tinting, of
course, over the underlying pictorial composition
would add, by contrast of tone, to the illusion.</p>

<p>A blank sheet of celluloid placed over the entire
drawing is often employed to hold components
of some quickly moving element of an incident.
Each separate detail of its drawing, in this case,
is made on this blank celluloid under the camera
and photographed as it is made. Supposing that
it is lightning zigzagging across a dark background.
There will be drawn over this celluloid the first
part of the bolt, photographed and then another
part drawn which is photographed, and then the
end of the bolt which is also separately taken.
This drawing of the lightning-bolt, in white pigment,
can be easily rubbed off with a paint rag,
or cotton wadding, and then another lightning-bolt
drawn and photographed in the same way.</p>

<p>In some cases where a large volume of smoke
is to be shown in hurried movement, the animator
draws the smoke in distemper pigment—sombre
dark grays, half-tints, or in white—on a blank<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>
sheet of celluloid covering the scene. The effect
of smoke moving very quickly could also be drawn
in progressive fragments on the upper surface
of the glass in the frame that is pressed down
upon the drawings each time that they are photographed.
If it is a house burning, for instance,
the flames in white paint and the smoke in grays
and black can be put on its surface.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp90" id="i_161" >
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_161.png" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption">A cycle of three drawings is sufficient to give a vivid representation of the
puffing exhaust from an automobile.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Little happenings that form part of a general
scene are managed, as a rule, too, by cycles of
drawings or cycles of details in a drawing. To
specify a few things, we may cite puffs of vapor
from an automobile, steam pouring out of the
spout of a teakettle, and smoke from a chimney.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span></p>

<p>Vapor, steam, and smoke are best represented
by pigment, as hard ink contours are not exactly
suited for such elements of a pictorial composition.
But such elements defined by ink lines in
a comic drawing are, of course, excusable. Sometimes
to show smoke moving where the drawings
are all on paper, representing it by crayon-sauce
with a stump has been found to be effective.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp90" id="i_162" >
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_162.png" alt="BOMB!">
  <figcaption class="caption">AN EXPLOSION.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>If an artist is picturing in a comic cartoon the
firing of a cannon, he indicates a globular projectile
leaving the cannon’s mouth. The artist
does not do this because of any scrupulous care
in picturing reality but merely that it seems in
keeping with the idea of vivid comic delineation.</p>

<p>In producing the appearance of a cannon-ball
following its trajectory off into the far distance
he takes heed of the law of perspective that requires
an object to become visionally smaller
as it nears the horizon. This animation is easily<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>
managed. A certain number of models of the
missile are cut out of thin cardboard graduated
in size from the first that leaves the cannon’s
mouth to the smallest for the distance. They
are used by putting one at a time in their proportionate
places under the camera in connection
with the other work during the photography.
Not many of these models would be required, as
the action is so rapidly represented that almost
any sort of illusive effect will do for the purpose.</p>

<p>According to the popular idea, every comic
scenario should provide for some cataclysmic
climax in which the entire picture area, or a large
part of it, is to be filled with the graphic symbols
denoting an explosion or any sudden occurrence
or mishap. Such things for the animator are
not hard.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span></p>
Then radiating lines, exclamation-points, zigzagging
lines, and similar whimsical markings—shorthand signs
emphasizing the comic note—are
ideographs of expression that the animator delights
to put into his work. Besides their forcibleness,
they add variety to the film.

<p>But bits of dramatic business like these should
be used in moderation and in their proper places
and always at the right time. Besides, being
easily drawn, their accomplishment on the film
presents no difficulties.</p>

<p>The several methods by which they can be
produced are: (1) To arrange their components<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>
in cycles; (2) drawing them in their order under
the camera and photographing progressively;
(3) have little cut-out pieces to move about under
the camera and photographed at each place that
they have been moved to.</p>

<p>Take for instance such a nonsensical conceit
as that of having a constellation of stars encircling
a dazed man’s head. This could be made by
having (1) a cycle of drawings for the effect; or
(2) drawing it progressively under the camera
over a piece of celluloid; or, again, (3) by having
a number of little stars cut out of paper and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>
moved around and manipulated the same as other
cut-out models.</p>

<p>One can see from all these particulars that making
animated cartoons is not always a matter of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>

make very little progress if he were to refuse
to take advantage of any proper expedients or

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uc">Many</span> of the striking ways of telling incidents
of an animated cartoon put one
in mind of the pictorial symbols of primitive man.
An example is that of a vision appearing above
the head of some one in doubt or in a revery.
Then there is the miniature scene floating over a
sleeper to tell that of which he is dreaming. These
and other similar forms are supplementary ways
of explaining incidents in a screen story. They
are also used in the regular photographic film;
but they are specifically typical of the animated
cartoon.</p>

<p>They are amusing additions to a film that are
certain to please whether used to apprise the
audience of what is going on in the character’s
mind, or to explain the dream of a sleeper as he
lies abed.</p>

<p>There are several modes of creating any of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>
these effects. The usual way would be that of
having the quiescent part, say it is a sleeper,
limned on the celluloid; and the details of the
moving part, say the vision, on three or five
sheets of paper.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption">SYMBOLIC ANIMATION OF SNORING.

<p class="subcap center">To effect this, the sleeper would be drawn on celluloid and the pictures in
the clouds on separate sheets of paper.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Perhaps the humorist-artist wishes to make
his picture a little bit more telling by indicating,
with appropriate onomatopœic consonants, the
sound of snoring. These additions can be drawn
while the photography is taking place on a blank
celluloid sheet superimposed over all the drawings
in a way explained in a preceding chapter.</p>

<p>Symbols of musical notation and sound-imitating<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>
words are often introduced into a screen
picture. They can be made to dance in rhythm,
or at haphazard, by drawing them in series of
three or so, on celluloid sheets. These would be
placed, one at a time, in their order over the general
scene and repeated as long as desired.</p>

<p>The employment of balloons—they have been
alluded to before—is a frequent one in comic
screen work. They are the mouthpieces containing
the dialogue of the characters. Their
outline, more or less balloon-shaped, hovers over
the heads of the speakers. The lines defining the
balloons can come into the scene gradually in a
lively way, and the dialogue itself can come in
word by word. This latter scheme itself suggests
talking.</p>

<p>When the first animated cartoons were produced
and an effect with balloons was intended,
the artist thought that he was doing well enough
if he showed the lettering and merely had the
person supposed to be speaking standing motionless.
But now an artist who cares enough
for his craft to put as much business into the scenes
as possible will show the lips moving and the
arms gesticulating at the same time that the lettering
appears.</p>

<p>There are innumerable things that the artist
must think of while he is photographing his drawings,
and one of the weighty ones is to have the
lettering for any particular dialogue, or explanation,
held long enough on the screen for it to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>
read. Every studio has its own special rule as to
the number of separate frames of a film to allow
for a word. The only way to arrive at any conclusion
as to how much film to take for any
sentence in a balloon, or on a title, is to have
some one read it and then time this reading. In
this way the artist will be able to tell how much
to give any particular wording. He will be able,
too, after a while, to formulate his own rule with
regard to the matter.</p>

</figure>

<p>A favorite method of telling something, or to
hint as to that which is to follow, is to have a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>
character discovered reading a newspaper upon
which the item explaining the matter shows in
an exaggerated type. The design is usually enclosed
within a circle with the outside space a
solid black. There is no special reason for using
this particular encircling design. It is a way
often used. Technically
it is a good plan
to employ this telescopic
mat, as it
may be called, as its
forcible contrast of
solid black margin
breaks the monotony
of the general uniform
photographic
tone of the rest of
the film.</p>

<p class="subcap">To vivify this on the screen, little
“model” hats are used during the

</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>An amusing occurrence
sometimes
brought into a story
is that of having a
man’s hat fly from
his head into the air
and come down upon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>
his head again. Of course, the practical way of
putting this on a length of film would be that of
having a little cut-out dummy. The artist, however,
takes the trouble of making several dummies
of the hat drawn in different views. A single
dummy would show but a mere mechanical turning,
but by using several in different views, he
gets a very good similitude of actuality in the
wind twirling the hat around in a lively way. A
little point to help the humor of the situation is
that of having the hat hesitate, as it were, and
give an extra spin immediately before it lands
upon the head.</p>

<p>It isn’t always necessary for an artist to make
a cycle or a series of drawings for a movement.
For instance, he is showing a rather large face
on the screen and it is intended that the eyes
move. This could be effected by drawings, but
there is a much simpler way. The places for the
eyes on the main drawing are left blank and holes
cut out the size of these blank spaces. On a narrow
piece of paper at the proper distance, two
eyes are drawn. This paper, with the eyes, is
slipped underneath the one with the drawing
that has the eye spaces cut out. Now the manipulation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>
of this paper, holding the eyes while in
position under the face, is easy. The various positions
in which the eyes are placed, it is understood,
will be photographed by the stop-motion
method.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp80" id="i_178" >
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_178.png" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption">“CUT-OUT” EYES.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The true artist, in keeping with his talent for
creative work, will be disposed to devise helpful
contrivances or expedients to lighten irksome
and monotonous details arising in this art. And
in addition to the possession of this talent, and
that of good draftsmanship, he must be quick
in deciding on the best means of economizing
labor, so that he can spend more time where thorough
drawing is needed. He must, in short, in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>
any particular case, put in as much work as it
requires and no more. By experience he will
learn to know where to slight—“slight” isn’t exactly
the word, but it will do—the drawing.</p>

<p>With respect to this latter point, suppose
there is some arm movement, with the arm swinging
as it does in a hurried walk. Hands, it is certain,
are difficult details to draw, and if they are
carefully rendered in all of the positions it would
take a long time to draw the entire series. But
the experienced animator has learned that at
times he can, for some of the positions, every
other one perhaps, make quickly lined marks
indicative of hands. These quickly made lines,
however, must be drawn in a way that will help
the action. Exactly how to make them and to
what extent to “slight” them is learned only by
long experience.</p>

</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span></p>

<p>Often there is a question as to the number of
drawings necessary for a movement. If a hand,
for example, is to be moved from the side of the
thigh to the head and then to touch the brim of
the hat, one single position half-way between the
two extreme ones may do for some swift action
in a humorous cartoon, but if it is for a slower
action it should have at least three positions between
the extremes.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption">ILLUSTRATING THE NUMBER OF DRAWINGS REQUIRED FOR
A MOVEMENT.<br>

</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>But it doesn’t worry the skilled animator very
much whether he makes three, five, or even more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>
drawings between the extreme positions of any
gesture or action. Nevertheless, while the artist
is making these arm movements he must put
thought into the work. There is, for instance,
a certain matter with respect to drawing the relative
axes of the segments of a limb that requires
reflective attention. To be precise, suppose the
action is to represent an arm moving from below
and pointing with the index-finger skyward. Now,
in any directly following phases of the movement
the same degree of flexure at the articulations must
not be present in the drawings. The whole arm
as it hangs by the side, before the action begins,
is nearly straight, with very little bending at either
elbow or wrist. In moving it upward, it is not
to be traced with this same relative straightness
and same degree of joint angularity in all the
positions. It would move then on the screen with
the ungracefulness of an automaton.</p>

<p>Instead, the several drawings should have the
joints—elbow and wrist—at different degrees of
flexure. Especially is this difference to vary
from one drawing to a succeeding one, with the
angle at the joint, just a little more, or just a
little less. The whole matter can be best comprehended<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>
if the artist, before depicting this action,
try it himself. Then he would see that if
he moves the arm as if it were a rigid thing, only
hinged at the shoulder, the movement would
be false and not characteristic of a living organism.
The natural way is an unconstrained, easy
bending movement. The animator in his drawings
slightly emphasizes this manner of moving.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span></p>

<p>An artist shows his aptness for character delineation
in the way in which he draws the views of
a face for turning it from side to side. A graphic
caricaturist of limited scope has a proneness for
adhering to a few stencil patterns, in the matter
of pose, for his characters. Front face, profile,
and occasionally a three-quarter view make up
his catalogue of facial picturing. The animator
uses this delineatory trilogy, too, in the ordinary
turning of the head from side to side. But he
must be skilled, besides that of portraying a face
in these views, in drawing it in any view. And
a skill that is still more needed is that of being
able to keep the portraiture of a character throughout
any series of drawings.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp90" id="i_183" >
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_183.png" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption">

<div class="subcap">
In turning the head from profile to full face, one drawing between the

</div>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span></p>

<p>To keep the features the same throughout a
number of drawings it is found advantageous to
spend a little more time in the preliminary planning
when creating the original sketch for the
character. The idea is not so much to make a
face that is easy to draw as to give it certain distinguishing
lineaments that are recognizable in
the varying positions needed in animating it.</p>

<p>Besides, when originating a face for frequent
repetition in a cartoon, seeking one that can be
drawn quickly and easily represented in any view
facilitates the work of the tracers.</p>

<p>A little trick of comic graphic artists is that
of making the features of a face in small circles,
or somewhat roundish curves. This sort of thing
is not conducive to good character drawing. The
animator also uses these forms—round eyes, circle-like
nose, and a circular twist in other parts of
the features. Now in his case, this can be forgiven,
perhaps, when one considers the difficulties
of his art; for these particular forms are, as we
shall try to explain immediately below, easy to
copy and trace. As in caligraphy, unfixed and
diverse in its qualities and peculiarities, so with
every individual in pen drawing, certain traits<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>
occur in the strokes. In pen-and-ink drawing
the more individual and distinctive the style,
the harder it will be to copy or counterfeit it.
But if the markings approach the geometric,
definite and precise, then they are easily copied
and imitated. This is why the little circles and
similar curved markings are so frequently used
in animated cartoons. There is nothing ambiguous
in the lineaments of a face made with saucer-like
eyes, and a nose like a circle. Its peculiarities
are quickly noticed, easily remembered, and traced
with facility.</p>

<p>As has been explained, an artist rarely finishes
an entire set of drawings for a film without help,
but has a staff of helpers. It can be well understood,
then, that an essential to success is that
the members of this staff keep the same quality
of line in all the drawings. One of the difficulties
in a staff of helpers is that of keeping a uniformity
of portraiture in the characters. And because
the circular lineaments are easy to trace that is
the reason why they are chosen to form the basis
for the details of a face.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp60" id="i_186" >
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_186.png" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption">Easily drawn circular forms and curves make for speed in animated cartoon
work.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>There is a tendency in every one, even on the
part of the author of the original model, to depart<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>
from the first-planned type of face. The approved
way of avoiding this is to have a set of sketches
of the characters drawn on special sheets of paper
that are to be used by all the workers to trace
from. In a studio with numerous workers, all
rushing to finish a five-hundred-foot reel in every
week, it is the custom to have plates engraved
from the original sketches and a number of copies
printed, so that all may have a set. With these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>
printed copies it will then be merely a matter
of having a steady hand and an ability to trace
accurately from the copy on to a fresh sheet of
paper placed over the illuminated glass of the
drawing-board.</p>

<p>No doubt, as it has been referred to so many
times, it is clearly understood now what an important
part transparent celluloid plays in this
art. It is employed not only to save the labor
of reproducing a number of times the details of
a scene, but also to help keep these details coincident,
or uniform. In a face, there is a certainty
that its lineaments will be the same if it is drawn
but once on celluloid; but if it is copied each
time on a long string of successive sheets of paper,
there is a likelihood that it will vary and so give
the lines on the screen an effect of wiggling about.</p>

<p>There are many little matters of technic and
rendering that arise in this art. For example,
in making certain parts of a figure, say a coat,
in solid black, it has been found best, instead of
making it an absolute silhouette, to indicate by
the thinnest of white lines the contours of the
details. A sleeve, for instance, should be outlined
with such a white line. This seems to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>
a lot of trouble for so little, but, judged by the
result on the screen, has been shown to be worth
while.</p>

<p>At this point we can touch upon the question
of what is meant by “animation.” An artist
with little experience may make a series of movement
phases for an action, but when the drawings
are tested it is found that they do not animate;
that is, give in synthesis the illusion of easy motion.
It may be a matter of incorrect drawing, perhaps,
or he may have the drawings nearly correct,
but he has failed to make use of certain little
tricks, or, shall we say, failed to observe certain
dexterous points in the technic of the art?</p>

<p>We will cite one little trick—humoring the
vision, if one may put it this way: have a spot,
or patch, of black repeated relatively in the
same position throughout the series of a movement.
An example is that of having the boots
of a figure of a solid black. The eye catching
the two black spots as they alternately go back
and forth is deluded with respect to the forcibleness
of the animation even if the walking action
is not as correctly drawn as it should be. An
added effect is given to this illusory ruse if a tiny<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>
high light is left on the toe of each black
boot.</p>

<p>The final test for drawings for animation is,
it stands to reason, the result on the screen. One
may, though, approximately find out whether or
not any sequence of drawings animate by flapping
them in a sort of way akin to the book-form
kineograph novelty noted in a preceding chapter.
Two immediately following drawings can be
tested this way: with one hand they are held
near one corner pressed against the drawing-board,
then with the other hand the top drawing
is moved rapidly up and down. In this way the
two drawings are synthesized somewhat, and if
the action is delineated correctly there will be
some notion of the appearance on the screen.</p>

<p>This little experiment crudely demonstrates the
phenomenon of after-images and the operation
typifies a simple synthesizing apparatus.</p>

<p>A significant addition to a scene, if it is suited
to the story and consistent with the general plan,
is to have some foreground detail in front of the
moving figure, or figures. This sometimes consists
of a rock, a clump of foliage, or a tree trunk.
The contrast of the inertness in these details gives<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>
an added force to the animating that takes place
back of their mass.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp80" id="i_190" >
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_190.png" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption">


<p class="subcap">Foreground details of a pictorial composition help the animator in several
ways. Their inertness, for one thing, affords a contrast to the moving
figure.</p>
</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>This feature of a picture is drawn on celluloid
that is placed on top of the rest of the set having
to do with the particular animation. It is possible,
though, for an artist, if he is dexterous, to
fasten this inert foreground to the under-side of
the glass in the frame which is pressed down over
the drawings during the photography. The foreground
feature, of course, is cut out in silhouette
and fastened with an adhesive like rubber cement.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>
This cement is an article of great usefulness in a
photographic studio; especially for temporary
use over drawings, as it can be easily rubbed off
afterward by the friction of the finger-tips.</p>

<p>Radically opposite in method to the scheme
described above, in which an inert object helps
the animation, is the panorama. In this screen
illusion the figure, which is thought of as moving,
occupies the same position; while the landscape,
normally quiet, is in motion.</p>

<p>Certainly we have all experienced the sensation,
when seated in a railway-train waiting for
it to go, of suddenly imagining that it has started;
when, in fact, it has not budged. This simply
has happened: while occupied with thoughts not
pertaining to our surroundings—perhaps reading—we
casually caught sight of a moving train
on an adjacent track, and as we were in the state
of expectancy of at any moment being on the
move, we immediately thought that our anticipation
had been fulfilled. Even if, in a moment or
two, we realize that our senses have deceived
us, it is hard to shake off the first-formed delusion
of being in motion.</p>

<p>Now the screen panorama is a similar delusion.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>
We see near the centre of the screen a figure going
through the motions of progression, but we know
perfectly well that he is in the same place all the
time. And we know that the landscape is drawn
on a band of paper that is pushed along back of
the figure. All our knowing does not help us.
In spite of it the little figure spectrally advances
and the landscape deceptively passes by as we
know it does (visionally) when we ourselves are
running very fast.</p>

<p class="subcap">The figure is depicted in a series of movement phases drawn on separate sheets of celluloid. These are used continuously,
one at a time, and in their proper order during the photography. The landscape, drawn on a strip

</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The manner in which a panorama is produced
is this: the landscape is drawn on a long strip
of paper; this is to be moved little by little and
photographed at each place to which it has been
moved. The figure that is to walk, or run, is drawn
in the different phases of action on sheets of celluloid.
These are placed in their order over the
landscape during the photography. The separate
drawings of the actions of the figure were
drawn so that the bodies remained relatively
in the same place, but the limbs, or heads, varied
in attitudes. The planning of the action in a
figure for a panorama is proceeded with in the
same way as that for producing a regular walk
or run. One special care in the work, however,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>
is this: the limbs as they are sketched in their
appropriate attitudes in the several drawings
must not have identical outlines. That is, explaining
it in another way, if all of the set are
placed together over the illuminated tracing glass,
no two drawings should correspond with respect
to the positions of the limbs. The bodies in the
drawings should exactly concur in position, but
if some attention is given to the rise and fall of
the trunk, as in a typical walk, the screen illusion
will be very much better. Slightly shifting it
up and down on a vertical would effect this.</p>

<p>The band of paper with the landscape is moved
in the direction opposite to that in which the
figure is supposed to go.</p>

<p>The photographer has many things to think
of while he is putting this panorama effect on a
film. He must move the landscape strip; sometimes
as little as one-sixteenth of an inch at
a time; put a celluloid sheet with one of the
phases of the action in place, get it in its proper
order, and then turn the camera gearing to make
the exposure. In some special cases he will have
another matter to think of; namely, a second
panorama strip to move, and at a different speed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span></p>


<p>This is when he
wishes to give a little
better representation
of verisimilitude than
that produced by the
single panorama strip.</p>


<p>Far-off moving objects,
as we know, appear
to go slower than
those that are close to
us. We are aware of
this in looking at a
distant airplane high
up in the sky that we
know is going very fast
but seems as though
it is going very slowly.
And at night an illuminated
railway-train
in the valley below us,
when we are on an
elevation, seems to creep along like a snail.</p>

<p>To bring it to pass that a panorama have the
effect of near objects going faster than those that
are distant, it is necessary to have two strips of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>
panorama details. One strip will represent the
foreground, which is to be moved much quicker,
one-eighth of an inch, or so. A second strip
will answer for the distance, which is moved,
about one-sixteenth of an inch, or even less. If
the foreground strip is moved at rather wide intervals,
the effect on the screen will be a little
like that which we see from the window of a railway-coach
when telegraph-poles and near objects
seem to fly by.</p>

<p>The panorama strip for the foreground is designed
with simple elements so that it can be cut
out in silhouette and laid over the other one.
With reference to the quality of the details of a
scene on a panorama; although it is usual to fill
up the whole length with items of interest, there
must be observed some degree of simplicity. Perhaps
it might be best to say that there should
be a subordination in the details, even if they
are numerous, and then have some striking feature
or object occurring every once in a while,
to catch the eye and so help the movement.</p>

<p>Objects, too, automobiles and other vehicles,
are combined with these panoramas. This brings
us to the consideration of the matter of animating<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>
wheels, or making them turn in the screen
illusion.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp70" id="i_197" >
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_197.png" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption">Some distinguishing mark on a wheel is needed to give it the screen illusion
of turning.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>A wheel true and accurately adjusted and going
rapidly gives—with the exception of a blurring
of spokes, if there are any—very little evidence
of rotation. It is only when it turns unsteadily,
or when there is some distinguishing mark found
on or near the rim, that we see plainly that the
wheel turns. Sometimes it is a stain, a spot on
the tire, a temporary repair, or a piece of paper
that has caught in the spokes that indicates a
turning of the wheel. Further amplification is
needless, as a glance at the vehicles, as they pass
in the roadway, will make clear. So the animator,
when he wishes to show a wheel turning,
simply copies actuality by drawing a wheel with
some such feature as noted above. A mere black
spot on a wheel near the circumference is sometimes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>
sufficient. It is usual to have the wheels
drawn on thin cardboard and cut out and fastened
in their proper places so that they can be
turned. They are turned a little at a time and
photographed after each turn.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uc">Respecting</span> adaptability and results, the
same motion-picture camera that is used
in the field, or the studio, can be used to make
films for animated cartoons. In making cartoons,
however, two particulars at variance with the
usual procedure first must be noted: (1) The
camera is pointed downward and not horizontally,
as is ordinarily the case, and (2) with each turn
of the camera handle only one frame—one-sixteenth
of a foot of film—is photographed, and not
eight, as is commonly the case.</p>

<p>The camera in making animated cartoons is
held, pointing downward, by a firmly built framework.
The artist, having decided on the dimension
of the field for his drawings, determines the
height approximately of the camera above the
table top, where the drawings are placed. Naturally
it will be high enough so that when he works<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>
at the table while disposing the drawings, adjusting
the dummies, or in some cases making
drawings, his head will not come in contact with
the front of the lens. The particular distance
between the lens and the table top is dependent
upon the kind of lens in the camera. It is a common
practice to equip a camera with a two-inch
(fifty-millimetre) lens. It is possible to use a lens
of this focus for cartoons.</p>

<p>There is no special type of structure for supporting
the camera above the board upon which
the drawings are placed for photography. An
artist contemplating embarking upon this line
of work, and intending to carry on the whole
process from the beginning to the time when he
hands the exposed film to the laboratory for development,
will have a chance to put any inventive
ability that he may have into practice in
designing a framework for the purpose. In building
such a structure these things must be thought
of: (1) The structure must be firmly built so that
the likelihood of the camera being jarred is lessened;
(2) the distance between the camera and
board to be ascertained, approximately at first;
(3) an arrangement for fixing the camera in a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>
grooved sliding section so that its exact height
can be adjusted when the field and focus are
definitely fixed or there is to be any later readjustment.
The camera, for instance, may get
jarred and put out of focus, or get set obliquely
with respect to the lines defining the field.</p>

each time that the size of field is changed,
a troublesome setting of the camera in order
again. It is wisdom to keep to one size of field
for all work, so that when the camera is once
in position it need not be changed.</p>

<p>The frame that holds the glass, and which is
hinged to the board where the drawings are placed,
and the registering pegs have already been described.
It is an excellent plan to have this board
with the above-named adjuncts separate but
screwed down upon the table top. By having
it this way it is possible to have another means
of getting the camera and the field lines adjusted.
Then if the outline of the field on the board and
those defining the field in the camera do not fit
each other exactly, the board can be unscrewed,
shifted until it is right, and fastened again.</p>

<p>In any film where there is a preponderance of
straight lines—horizontal ones, especially—it is
a serious fault to have the slightest obliquity.
It will be emphasized on the screen. The outlines
of the little rectangular area, where the pictures
are taken in the camera, must coincide with
the outlines of the field on the board. When the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>
field is fixed and permanently marked with ink
lines, it is a good plan to draw a smaller rectangle,
one-half inch all around, within the outer one.
The idea of this is to have a limiting area within
which all important matters of the drawing are
kept.</p>

<p>If the animator has had any experience with
the ordinary still camera, the practical knowledge
gained then will help him in the matter of focussing,
or regulating the diaphragm of the lens, so
that all the details of the picture are sharply defined.
This comes next, or rather in conjunction
with the determining of the field and the permanent
fixing of the camera. In a still camera—that
is to say, an ordinary portrait or view apparatus—the
focussing is on a ground glass, while in a cinematographic
instrument it is usual to place a
piece of celluloid with a grained surface somewhat
like ground glass into the place where the
film passes. The picture is focussed on this celluloid.
Some, however, find a piece of blank film
answers the purpose.</p>

<p>To the above consideration of setting up the
camera and ascertaining the correctness of the
field and the sharpness of the image, the worker<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>
wise in perception will, before beginning any important
work, make a test. This is merely a
matter of photographing a drawing, or two, on a
short length of film, taking it out of the camera,
and developing it. Here, again, any knowledge of
photographic processes previously learned will be
found useful.</p>

<p>There are in all metropolitan centres film
laboratories to which the animator can send his
exposed films to be developed and printed. But
for a test before beginning the work it is prudent
and expeditious to keep a supply of chemicals
on hand, and then, in a few minutes, it will be possible
to tell how matters stand in any particular
that is in doubt.</p>

<p>The next step, after the camera has been fixed
in place, is to construct a mechanism by which it
can be turned conveniently by the photographer,
as he is seated below at the board where the drawings
are placed. This is contrived by a system
of sprocket-wheels and chain-belts coming from
the camera and carried down to the side of the
table top, where it ends in a wheel with a turning
handle. For the average individual this would
not be a difficult construction to put up; but it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>
would be an altogether different problem if the
animator wished to equip his camera with an
electric motor to turn the camera mechanism.
In this case he would have many things to consider,
getting the particular type of motor, for
instance, that will operate with the continual
turning on and off of the power. Here certainly
the best course is to have an expert install the
motor and fix the intermediary mechanism connecting
it with the camera-working parts.</p>

<p>Electric motors to drive camera mechanisms
are in general use among those who make titles
for moving-picture films. For this particular
branch of the industry they are an indispensable
adjunct.</p>

FOR A TITLE.

<p>It would seem to the spectator in the theatre,
unfamiliar with the technic of cinematography,
that when he sees a title held on the screen for
any lengthy period, the practical way of effecting
this would be to have a single picture of
this title kept stationary during the period. But
this is not the way the matter is worked out. A
title in a screen story is given a certain length of
film, with every frame in this length containing
the same words. The particular length—footage—allowed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>
for a
title depends upon the
amount of its reading-matter.
Some
titles are very long.
One such, requiring,
say, fifteen feet,
makes it necessary to
turn the camera handle
two hundred and
forty times, if the
operation is by hand.
A very monotonous
job. So title studios
attach a motor and
appropriate mechanism
to a camera, and
with it, too, an automatic
counter.
Then in photographing
a title it is a simple
matter of starting
the mechanically
driven shutter, watching
the figures on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>
counter dial, and when the required exposures
have been registered, pulling the lever that stops
the mechanism. Where a camera, however, is
used for animated drawings exclusively, a motor
is not absolutely necessary.</p>

<p>An automatic counter would be a very useful
addition to a camera in making dissolves. One
form of these fantasies is that in which the screen
is perfectly black at first and then a small spot
of light appears, which grows larger by degrees,
to reveal at the full opening the scene or subject
of the film. This is produced by a vignetter,
or iris dissolve. A vignetter is a device, fixed
generally in front of a lens, that consists of a number
of crescent-shaped segments of thin metal
pivoted on a circumference. When these segments
move in unison toward the centre, they
gradually decrease the aperture in the lens tube.
But when the movement is in a contrary direction,
they cause the aperture to open by degrees.
Those who have used an ordinary snap-shot
camera no doubt are familiar with a similar device—the
iris diaphragm, or lens stop. But in the
diaphragm the segments do not completely close,
and there is always a tiny opening left in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>
centre. The iris dissolve, or vignetter, is made
to close completely.</p>

<p>The way by which pictures are “faded on”
is to start with the vignetter closed and then open
it while the camera handle is turned to take the
picture. To “fade off” a picture, the process
is simply reversed; <i>i. e.</i>, gradually closing the
vignetter while the last part of the picture is
being taken.</p>

<p>The most frequent application that an animated
cartoon artist makes of a vignetter is making
cross dissolves, or causing one picture to blend
into another. Imagine now that the idea to be
expressed, through the medium of one of these
cross dissolves, is that of a character standing
in an attitude of reflection and supposed to be
thinking of how he would look in a complete suit
of armor. There will be two drawings: one with
the figure in ordinary dress, and the other with
him clad in the armor. First the picture with
ordinary dress is photographed. During this
operation the vignetter is closed by degrees. When
it is closed, the film that was just photographed
upon is wound back again into the magazine.
Now, as we know, during this procedure the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>
light, which was getting weaker and weaker, proportionately
lessened its effect on the sensitized
emulsion of the film, so that its picture-forming
property was not all used up. There is still a
certain proportion of photographic potency left
for the next exposure. The next step is to replace
the first drawing with the one showing the character
in armor.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption">VIGNETTER, OR IRIS DISSOLVE.

<p class="subcap center"><em>Below</em>: Three stages during the movement of the pivoted segments.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>We left the vignetter completely closed, and
the same length of film that had just passed back<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>
of the lens has been wound back into the magazine
and is ready to cross the exposure field again
and be photographed upon the second time. Now
the vignetter is gradually opened, the new picture
is being taken and blended with the image
of the first picture.</p>

<p>These two procedures in their method of operating
and their effects compensate one another.
The gradual closing of the vignetter has its reciprocal
part in the gradual opening; the lessening
of the light strength is reciprocal to the increase of
the light strength; then the fading of definiteness
in one picture is made up by the gradually increasing
clearness in the other.</p>

<p>In trick work of this kind a mechanical counter
would be very useful in measuring the length of
film as it is turned into the magazine and then
out again. It is understood, of course, that our
particular counter also counts backward. And,
again, with reference to cameras: an animator
when he selects his camera should be certain that
he gets one with which it is possible to turn the
camera backward for making these dissolves and
any other trick work involving like manipulation.</p>

<p>Immediately above we gave certain reasons<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>
for the making of tests on a small piece of film
before photographing. Another matter for which
tests should be made is the question of illumination.
It is important that the field should be
evenly illuminated. All this is an affair of adjusting
the lights; that is, getting them one on
each side of the camera in their proper positions
with reference to the lens opening and the distance
away from the drawing-board.</p>

<p>The mercury vapor-lamp which, as has been
mentioned, is in general use for cartoon films,
has besides its illuminating qualities another
great merit. It is this: it does not emit heat
rays. When it is remembered that an artist sometimes
spends hours at a stretch photographing
his numerous drawings for a cartoon film, and
that all this time his head is but a few inches from
the lights, this absence of heat is a desirable
feature.</p>

<p>The manner of going about the photography,
which is the next stage of the work, has been
touched upon in another part of the book.</p>

<p>There are many more minute particulars in
the making of an animated film to be considered.
Take, for instance, the technical questions respecting
the preparation of the drawings. In the
process where most of the drawings are made on
paper, the paper should be a fair quality of white
linen ledger paper—but not too thick, as transparency
is a thing to think of, and it is preferable,
too, that there be no water-mark. The design
of a water-mark would be a disturbing element
in tracing from one drawing to another. Ordinary
black drawing ink is used for the line work,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>
but when a large area is to be solid black, it has
been found best to employ one of the black varnish
stains that are mixed with turpentine. In spite
of the turpentine medium it is possible to apply
it to paper. These black stains are an intense
black and do not lose their strength when viewed
through the celluloid sheets.</p>

<p>It is not usual to obliterate a mistake in drawing
with white pigment, as it is an uncertain quantity
in photography. Whether or not it will come
out as a patch of gray, or photograph correctly
as white, is difficult to judge beforehand. It is
best to take out ink lines that are not wanted with
a sharp-bladed penknife and then smooth the surface
of the paper with an ink eraser (of rubber).</p>

<p>In drawing over the smooth surface of the
celluloid a preliminary cleaning with weak ammonia
water will make the ink flow evenly. It
is of course understood that the celluloid sheets
can be used again after any particular film is
finished. Ink or pigment can very easily be
washed off with water.</p>

<p>In drawing on celluloid with a pen it is well
to select one that will not scratch the surface.
Scratches will hold, in their shallow depths, enough<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>
ink or pigment to break the evenness of a uniform
background. They will come out as spots on
the film. A well-worn pen, one that has been
“broken in,” as the pen draftsmen say, is the
best.</p>

<p>The scheme of employing celluloid sheets to
hold simple ink drawings, which scheme is in
common usage in the art, has been adapted to
the purpose of holding intricate drawings in distemper
pigment. Before drawing any series of
movements on celluloid it is the usual plan to
work out all the scenes and actions on paper first
and then trace them, from these drawings, to the
surface of the celluloid.</p>

<p>When the drawings for a cartoon have been
photographed, the magazine into which the exposed
film has been wound is taken out of the
camera. Then, in the dark room, the film is taken
out of this magazine and put into a regulation
tin can and sent to the laboratory. And so as
to make it quite certain that the lid will not slip
off and spoil the whole reel, it is sealed around
the edge with a piece of adhesive tape.</p>

<p>After the film has been developed, the next
step in the process is that of printing the positive.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>
This as well as the remaining technical
matters is attended to by the laboratory. Titles,
to be sure, could have been made at the same
time that the animated pictures were taken; but
it is found advisable to have titles made by a
studio that does this work exclusively and then
have them joined to the film in their proper order.</p>

PRINTER.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>With respect to this joining, or splicing, this
is also looked after for the animator at the film
laboratory. But as it is not difficult to do, the
animator—impatient to have his film completed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>
and not caring to wait until the laboratory finish
it—will try his hand at it, no doubt.</p>

<p>He needs for this a little device to hold the
two ends of the film together in their proper relationship
while he spreads on the overlapping
section a little film cement. This is a firm adhesive.
The emulsion on the film where the
cement is spread must be removed by a little
moistening.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span></p>

<p>When the positive is entirely finished, with
main title and subtitles, it is ready for screen
examination. Then only will the artist be able
to see, as a finality, his skill as an animator, his
expertness as a technical worker, his cleverness
as a humorist, and the extent of his adroitness in
plot construction.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uc">The</span> purpose of the animated cartoon being
to amuse, the experienced animator makes
it his aim to get, as the saying goes in the trade,
a laugh in every foot of film. The animated cartoon
is allied in its kind to an extravagant farce
or a lively comedy of the spoken stage.</p>

<p>Although strongly limned character and that
there be something moving all the time seem
to be the two important ingredients of a film of
this type, it is not to be forgotten that plot is
an essential in the work.</p>

<p>Naturally, a scenario, or skeletonized plan of
the story, is written out first. The full details
of the action and business, from the beginning
to the very end, are not worked out as they are
in a manuscript for a stage play. It is simply
that some sort of a framework, on which to build
the story, is first required.</p>

<p>In the early days of the art a film with a string<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>
of incidents only, but with plenty of movement
in the animated figures, would find a ready market
and an appreciative audience. At the present
time not only must the pictorial properties be
well rendered imageries of nature but the story
must be artistic in form. This signifies that the
idea of plot, and all its attendant concomitants,
should be present. The usual requirements of
a dramatic story are now sought for in an animated
cartoon. The plot must be the orderly
establishment of parts leading up to some main
point, or the working to a climax and a subsequent
untangling of it all.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp80" id="i_224" >
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_224.png" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption">PLENTY OF MOVEMENT IS DEMANDED IN SCREEN
PICTURES.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>If the artist does write the first sketch of the
play himself, he at least will elaborate it and add
various bits of dramatic business. This is all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>
very well if he understands and knows what he
is about, but if, on the other hand, he has not the
dramatic idea, his additions are quite likely to
confuse the story.</p>

<p>Whether a film is for the purpose of amusement
or to educate, the plan should show that the attainment
of something is being striven for. In
an educational film this is brought about by an
adherence to pedagogical principles. If it is a
comic story, due regard must be paid to dramatic
construction.</p>

<p>It is obvious that if a humorous scenario has
but two characters this will simplify the telling,
and the idea of their antagonisms, obstacles, and
embarrassing difficulties are easily told. The clash
and the struggle between the two can be expressed
in many simple ways, the story carried on, curiosity
stimulated, and an expectant feeling engendered
as to what will happen. The final
episode is apt to be some calamitous fall with the
whole picture area perhaps filled with a graphic
representation of an explosion, to be followed by
an after-climax, when the smoke has cleared away,
of the victim rubbing his head.</p>

<p>To be sure, an animated cartoon needs a good<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>
many more incidents than one calamitous occurrence.
It is indispensable, for the sake of an
uninterrupted animation, that it should have a
succession of distressing mishaps, growing in violence.
This idea of a cumulative chain of actions,
increasing in force and resultant misfortune, is
peculiarly adapted to animated drawings.</p>

<p>The animator, if he is a good draftsman, can
manage his little picture people much easier than
the theatrical manager does the members of his
company. A great danger, nevertheless, is that
the animator, with this facility of doing whatever
he pleases with his characters, may overdo
the matter. He must be careful that he does not
create too much business for his actors, and so
retard the sequence of those episodes proper to
the plot.</p>

<p>The very best type of animated cartoon tells
the story from the very first incidents and throughout
its whole continuance to the crisis, and the
ending by pantomimic acting only. This means
that there is no dialogue lettered on the drawings
themselves. Symbolical signs, like exclamation-marks,
sound-suggesting letters, or the like, are
naturally proper and happy additions to drawings;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>
but as little dialogue as possible should
be used in drawings. They break the continuity
of the animation, for one thing. Although it is
true that balloons with their wording make an
easy way for the animator to have the automatic
counter register “footage” (a consideration appealing
to the business sense of the artist), it is
only when there is a good jest brought out that lettering
on the drawings themselves can be forgiven.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption">THE PLAINT OF INANIMATE THINGS CAN BE RENDERED
EFFECTIVELY ON THE SCREEN.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>In the early period of the development of animated
comic drawings, not even subtitles were
interspersed throughout a film. The entire story
was told by pantomime. Nowadays it is becoming
the fashion to use subtitles, and have them
to introduce incidentals, mark a change of scene,
or bring in a witty remark. Wording brought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>
into a cartoon film this way is often felicitous and
technically legitimate. But dialogue, as has been
stated, should be kept out of the drawings themselves,
not only for the sake of artistic form, but
for commercial reasons. (Films intended for
exportation to countries where English is not
spoken are much more valuable if they are without
lettering in the pictorial parts. With all wording
on separate titles, it is very easy to change
them and have them joined to the film proper.)</p>

<p>The above statement with its frank allusion
to a matter of business seems to be getting away
from our subject; but it is not, as it calls to our
attention the principal quality of a comic screen
drawing—namely, pantomime—and it emphasizes,
too, the universality of pantomime. An
animated cartoon clever in gesturing is understood
by all races.</p>

<p>It is to be remembered that pantomime is a
matter of interpretation, both on the stage by
an actor and by the artist when he essays to represent
it pictorially. If it were an actual copying
of nature, it only would be as interesting as a
normal photograph; and that is not very interesting.
As in all interpretative arts there is a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span>
slight betrayal of the mechanical means, or processes,
so in pantomime there is a suggestion of
the mechanistic. Let us recall the rhythmical
and toy-like movements of the actors whom we
have seen playing in some whimsical dumb show.</p>

<p>How often do the clowns pretend in their
foolery that they are automatons, or that they
can move only by mechanistic motions. They
find need, too, in their ludicrous acting, for mechanical
properties—slap sticks, absurd objects,
or toys.</p>

<p>It is very certain that there are some forms of
motion productive of laughter that do not imitate
actions natural to the human organism, but seem
to acquire their power of risibility from their resemblance
to mechanical motion. This is on
the order of the notion that Bergson has elaborated
upon in his treatise in explanation of the
comic. He states, in substance, as one law of
the ludicrous, that the human body appears laughable
when its movements give a similitude of
a machine in operation. There is no question of
the correctness of this view as a matter of mere
exterior observation. Rather it seems to us that
machine-like movements in organic bodies amuse<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>
us because of the rhythmic, orderly, or periodic
occurrences of these movements in themselves,
and not to any matter of comparison.</p>

<p>In a boisterous low comedy it is always incumbent
upon the victim of a blow to reel around
like a top before he falls. It never fails to bring
laughter. An effect like this is easy to produce
in animated cartoons. There is no need to consider
physiological impossibilities of the human
organism, the artist can make his characters spin
as much as he pleases.</p>

<p>In a screen picture two boys will be seen fighting;
at first they will parry a few blows, then
suddenly begin to whirl around so that nothing
is visible but a confused mass and an occasional
detail like an arm or leg. It will be exactly like
a revolving pinwheel. This is made on the film
by having a drawing representing the boys as
clinched and turning it around as if it were a pinwheel.</p>

<p>In a panorama screen effect it seems to be sufficiently
realistic, for laughter purposes, to have
the legs and arms of the individual in a hurry
give a blurred impression, in some degree, like
that of the spokes of a rapidly turning wheel.</p>

<p>It is an indisputable fact that the human mind
finds fascination in any movement resembling
a rotary one. Witness the interest that a novel
mechanism or an automatic toy creates in a shop-window.
Such interest is still further stimulated if
there is an added item of anything of the human,
or something definite accomplished in the operations.</p>

<p>We require, it seems, if we are really alive, not
occasional, but constant, stimuli of some sort.
When we become weary of toil—which in itself
is often an unwelcome and imposed form of stimulus—we
seek stimuli in recreation. Or if we
haven’t energy enough for the self-stimulation of
sports, or the like activity, we look for it outside
of ourselves.</p>

<p>Perhaps it is music, exciting us metronomically;
or a play where our emotions are agitated—rhythmically
or in dissonance; maybe it is a circus
or the music-hall, where color and sound vibrations
stimulate us. Everywhere it will be some
form of measured time, movement, or rotation,
whether the theme be comic or serious.</p>

<p>Idlers will stop to gaze at a machine in motion
where there is building going on, or they will stop<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span>
to peer into the windows of a busy factory. There
is something in all this that shows that the human
mind craves the periodicity of stimulation.</p>

<p>Perhaps one of the reasons why those crudely
executed white on black animated cartoons—alluded
to in a preceding chapter—are so laugh-provoking
is that they represent the characters
performing their antics more or less mechanically.
A windmill effect, a twirling, a spinning, and a
merry-go-round movement are of striking import
in animated cartoons. They never fail to cause
laughter when depicted in some such fashion or
other.</p>

<p>Sometimes in a pursuit in a comic picture there
is an introduction of a chase around a house or
around a tree. The gyration about the house is
particularly productive of laughter. The slight
interruption while the figure passes back of the
house gives occasion for the necessary pause in
this comic business.</p>

<p>The author recalls a film of real people and
scenes that exemplified the potency of a mechanical
turning and the value of a pause for laugh-provoking
purposes. The scene represented a
tiny bungalow that was blown from its foundation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span>
by the force of the storm and made to revolve
as if it were pivoted in the centre. The
droll character of the play saved himself from
being blown away by clinging to one corner of
the porch. The laughter of the audience although
continuous came in waves of different strength.
The twirling house itself caused laughter, but it
increased when the ludicrous figure clinging to
the porch came into view, and it decreased when
he disappeared while he was being twirled around
the far side of the house.</p>

<p>Possibly one of the reasons why this performance
was so successful was because this movement
allowed for the physiological necessity of a
rest on the part of the spectators. The emotional
excitement would have been fatiguing to the
breaking point had the incitement to laughter
been continuous. The humorous proceeding operated
so that any individual member of the audience
was not compelled to shake or be agitated
by laughter all the time, but could slacken up
and rest rhythmically.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption">A cycle of drawings, like those above, used in turn and repeated for a
time will give the screen illusion of a man spinning like a top.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The need of a rhythmic slowing-up, or pause,
to allow for a respite for the emotions and the
convulsed physical organism is well illustrated in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span>
the following incident often introduced into animated
scenes. A little figure is observed running
up hill and down dale. The manner of his
performance is like this: he runs up the first hill
and disappears; there is a moment or so when the
scene is empty and during which he is supposed
to be running down the far side of the hill. Soon
he is discovered running up the second hill, at the
top of which he again disappears for a time to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>
run down its far side. In another moment he is
scrambling up the next hill and down the other
side again. This continues until he is lost as a
tiny black spot near the horizon.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp80" id="i_236" >
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_236.png" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption">A blurred impression like that of the spokes of a turning wheel is regarded
as funny in comic picturing.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>This disjointed hill-climbing causes hilarious
laughter and, as in the case cited above, comes in
waves. The rise and fall of the laughter waves
can be distinguished as the little figure runs up
the hills and down the valleys.</p>

<p>A pause is a necessary element in any continued
comic situation. It is, in fact, proper to any
series intended to arouse the emotion of laughter.
And in some respects a pause corresponds to the
negative moment of flexion—adverting our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>
thoughts for a moment to physical activity—while
the outburst of laughter corresponds to the
positivity of extension.</p>

<p>A bit of striking animation is that of having a
continuous stream of individuals pouring out of
a building, or a procession of funny animals coming
out of a receptacle from which we did not
expect such a parade. These episodes of movement
do resemble a parade—a species of regularly
recurring stimulation.</p>

<p>The psychological questions in regard to these
effects is related certainly to the matter of the
delight of the human mind in a stirring up by
repetition. Undoubtedly the same liking or pleasure
in these little bits of screen animation bear
a resemblance to the delight experienced in watching
a parade. What is there in a spectacle of this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>
sort that tickles our senses? Is it the regularness
of the step-keeping, the hypnotic music of the
band, or the show of varied uniforms? Perhaps
the principles of unity and variety—two essentials
of any art work—enter into the matter. The
variety in the uniforms of the different sections
satisfies the eye, and the unity of the marching
pleases the mind.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p>FROM “THE ‘BAB’ BALLADS.”</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Keeping step is an artificial recurrence of movement.
It pleases, of course, but when this motion
is rendered strongly mechanistic it takes on immediately
an element of the comic. In some of
the little figures drolly drawn by Bab (W. S. Gilbert,
of “Pinafore” and “Mikado” fame), this is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span>
well expressed. A little picture of his, for instance,
shows three tiny men stepping out like mechanically
operated toys.</p>

</figure>

<p>One of the most primitive of practical jokes
is that of throwing a stone at a hat on some one’s
head. And its most aggravated form as a joke
is that in which the hat is of a stovepipe pattern.
In a humorous stage play, merely to show an
individual with a stone in his hand while a sprucely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span>
dressed one wearing a high hat is passing is motive
enough to cause laughter. The graphic artist
copies this situation by representing a stone in
the air nearing the hat. Action lines, as they are
called, indicate that the missile is flying through
the air. In both of these cases—in reality and in
the picture—mere anticipation is enough to
awaken the risibilities. The animator, of course,
can gratify both the spectator’s joy of anticipation
and the mischievous delight of seeing the
consummation of the action.</p>

<p>Many professional entertainers have built their
reputation on some dramatic business with hats.
Either they wear some odd head-gear or else it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span>
will be in their manner of wearing a hat or a trick
in doffing it. If a hat is too small, it is sure to
create laughter; and if too large, it is a certainty
that there will be mocking hilarity. And even
if it is of the right size, it need only to be perched
on the head at an angle to be considered ludicrous.</p>

<br>
<br>ANIMATED EDUCATIONAL FILMS AND THE
FUTURE</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uc">Nearly</span> everything in our book so far, in
accord with its title, has had reference to the
making of comic screen drawings. They gratify
a proper human longing and they strike a responsive
chord in the consciousness. Now there
is another kind of appeal, in the matter of satisfying
a human need, to which animated screen
drawings can be put. It is that touched upon
in the introductory chapter; namely, animated
films of educational subjects. By educational
films would be meant, if the strict definition of
the term is intended, only those that are instructional.
It is to be remarked, however, that enlightened
opinion now includes in the category
of educational subjects any theme, or story for
children, even if a slight touch of the humorous
or diverting is to be found in it.</p>

<p>The kind of stories, with the latter thought particularly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span>
in mind, especially fitted for the screen
are those of Lewis Carroll. His “Alice in Wonderland”
is a good example of the type of fanciful
tale on the order of which animated cartoons could
be made for children.</p>

<p>And Sir John Tenniel’s interpretations of the
characters seem to have been created especially
for translation to the animated screen. The Mad
Hatter, with his huge beaver (signalizing again
the hat as inspiring the comic), would make an
admirable figure to pace across the screen.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp90" id="i_246" >
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_246.png" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption">THE MAD HATTER.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>An artist desiring to be the author of an animated
story built on the model of Carroll’s classics
would need a gleeful imagination and a turn for
the fantastic. And he would require, besides,
if he hoped to draw characters on a par with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span>
Tenniel’s depictions, more than the ordinary qualifications
of a screen draftsman.</p>

<p>As in the rough-and-tumble antics of the rustic
clown little refinement is either prevalent or expected,
so in the ordinary comic animated cartoon
exquisiteness of drawing is neither found
nor ordinarily looked for. But in a story with
fineness of wit, and told artistically, it is obligatory
that its interpretation be of a corresponding
quality. It is necessary, in other words, that
the artist be good at figure work and especially
skilful in drawing difficult actions and perspective
walks. As remarked before, when the latter
subject was considered, this requires dexterity
in picturing figures in foreshortened views. And
to become expert in this particular means study.
For examples of foreshortened figures to contemplate,
the student of animation can find no better
ones than those in the frescos of Michael Angelo.
Especially valuable are the decorations of the
Sistine Chapel in Rome. Photographs or copies,
no doubt, of these wonderful art works can
be found in the print-rooms of public libraries
or in any collection of engravings of a picture-gallery.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span></p>

</figure>

<p>It is an entertaining speculation as to whether
or not Michael Angelo, being a man of many artistic
activities, would have tried his hand at
animating drawings, had the art been in existence
in his time.</p>

<p>In our own day, patterns for emulation in
the matter of depicting action and the delineation
of character are found in the drawings of
Mr. A. B. Frost. Witness his achievements in
these respects in his book “Stuff and Nonsense.”
Then, too, Mr. Frost’s appreciation of the comic
spirit is particularly noteworthy. His graphic
work could with every success be set forth on
the animated screen.</p>

<p>The old-fashioned peep-show has long since
passed its way, and in its place has come the cinematographic
exhibition. Children consider it a
commonplace occurrence in their lives to be taken
to the “movies.” Very soon they will imbibe
knowledge as well as receive entertainment through<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span>
the medium of the films. There are many instructional
themes that could be elucidated in
the school by animated drawings.</p>

<p>Educational, travel, and scenic films are frequently
presented in motion-picture theatres,
but the possibilities in these subjects have not
been exhausted.</p>

<p>Some of the first investigators who looked into
the problems connected with photographic analysis<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[251]</span>
and pictorial synthesis to produce the appearance
of movement had ideas of applying the
results of their labors to practical purposes. M. G.
Demeny, in Paris, to cite an instance, invented
an instrument by which deaf-mutes could learn
to speak and to read lip movements. His instrument
consisted of an optical contrivance that
gave the representation of a person speaking by the
turning of a glass disk upon
which there was placed a
series of photographs of a
person speaking. The pictures
were arranged in a
cycle which, when the disk
was made to rotate, produced
a continuous effect
of the action.</p>

<figure class="figright illowp40" id="i_251" >
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_251.png" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption">DEMENY’S PHONOSCOPE.

<p class="subcap center">Modified from a picture in
 <cite>La Nature</cite>, 1892.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>One form of this apparatus,
or photophone, was
made to be turned by
hand, and the combined picture or illusion viewed
through a lens by one person at a time. Another
type was constructed so that the synthesized picture
of the speaking face could be thrown on a
screen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</span></p>

<p>There is a natural curiosity in nearly every
one to want to know about methods in art. And
the interest is general in watching a craftsman
create an object of art, or an artist bring into
graphic being some imagery of his brain. It
would not be out of place for these reasons, as
well as a matter of instruction, to produce films
showing art methods.</p>

<p>Especially for elementary pupils would it be
a desirable thing to show the way of making
simple free-hand drawings. Then, instead of an
instructor repeating the process—sometimes with
indifferent interest or enthusiasm—it can be arranged
that some one skilled in drawing, and
when he is feeling at his best, go through the
procedure under the motion-picture camera. The
result could be multiplied a number of times and
shown in many classrooms with an evenness of
performance not possible when some one does
it day in and day out.</p>

<p>Methods and principles of the more advanced
branches of art instruction—pictorial composition,
for instance, could be taught, too.</p>

<p>As one example, we will suppose that the purpose
is to show what good pictorial composition<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[253]</span>
is. First an indifferent picture, poorly arranged,
is shown; the various components appear on
the screen exactly as they would in making a
picture on canvas or paper; then little things
pointed out that are lacking in artistic merit, or
an explanation given of any detail that is not quite
clear. (For this purpose a drawing of a pointer
is made on cardboard and cut out in silhouette.
It is moved around precisely as if it were a real
pointer.) After showing the faulty construction
the various components can be moved again,
but into places to form the well-composed picture.</p>

<p>Methods of designing in the crafts could be
demonstrated by animated drawings; and they
could also be employed to explain visually the
story or history of design. Ornament can be
shown as it evolves from its natural form, to the
first rudimentary basic type; then it passes into
the best classical style, after which it becomes, as
in all art evolution, the merely decorative. And
it can be shown, as is usually the case in the history
of an ornamental form, terminating in a debased
and meaningless figure or scroll. All these
screen pictures could be managed so that the pictures<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span>
go through their mutations before the eyes
as if they were living things.</p>

<p>Presuming that in the acquiring of knowledge
all brains function in a similar way, what could
be better as a means of instruction than a film
of some educational subject?</p>

<p>In any special study or theme in physics, for
instance, an entire course could be planned for
an animated film. Some of the divisions of the
theme could be actual photographs of the experimental
apparatus in operation. But other matters
would need to be moving diagrams, or progressively
changing charts. Explanations on the titles
and other wording, previously thought out with
due regard to their educational value, would be
combined with the film.</p>

<p>Could there be anything more interesting than
screen drawings of machinery in operation? To
draw the successive pictures required for work
of this character would present no great difficulties
to any one trained in mechanical drafting.
It would be a great improvement on the diagrams
and mechanical plans with their complicated
markings to see the work of the draftsman projected
on the screen and giving the appearance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[256]</span>
of motion. With vivid object-lessons of this kind,
the eye can comprehend in a few moments that
which it would take lengthy paragraphs to make
clear.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp80" id="i_255" >
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_255.png" alt="On Celluloid: For Roker Arm; For Cams; For Valve;
 For Piston, Connecting Rod, etc; On Paper (Pistons)">
  <figcaption class="caption">A FEW OF THE DRAWINGS USED IN THE MAKING OF A FILM
TO SHOW A GASOLENE-ENGINE IN OPERATION.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>On this subject of animating machinery, it is
an interesting fact to note that as early as 1860,
Desvignes, who invented one form of the zootrope,
is recorded as having made a series of pictures
for his optical instrument that showed a
steam-engine in motion.</p>

<p>The teaching of history could be made still
more interesting than it is by series of changing
maps. Such maps would show, as their outlines
changed, the growth or modification of a country
as affected by events of history. Historical battles
could be illustrated with the usual reference marks
and symbols. But they would not be still; instead,
they would move about to illustrate the progress
of the battle. This form of animated maps frequently
has been used in connection with pictorial-news
reels.</p>

<p>Physiology and anatomy are two studies that
need good pictorial exposition in the classroom.
Scientific moving pictures of the actual subjects
are in many cases available and their photography<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[257]</span>
is feasible. But for some details that cannot be
taken with the camera, animated diagrams would
have to be substituted. To suggest a very
good theme in physiology, we may mention that
of the circulation of the blood. Only a few particulars
of this could be photographed. Most
of the story of the blood circulation would have
to be told by animated diagrams.</p>

<p>There would be at first, perhaps, a sectional
view of the heart showing the auricles, and ventricles
with the valves and their reciprocal action.
The flow of the vital fluid, to be sure, would be
indicated very clearly as it passes through the
cavities. A striking animation of this film would
be that of the blood flow in its course through the
body. This would be represented by a schematic
diagram like those usually set forth in the books.
It would have an added interest if the fluid were
colored—the arterial blood red and the venous
blood blue. (This is the usual way, when printed
in colors, in which they are distinguished in textbooks.)
A film like this, it can be understood,
must be planned well—a scenario practically
would be written for it.</p>

<p>The manner in which the muscles move the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[258]</span>
bony frame of the body
can be strikingly demonstrated
by animated
diagrams. Take as a
simple case the bending
of the arm. The two
antagonist muscles of
the front and the back
of the upper arm can
be made to show as
swelling and lengthening,
alternately, as they
flex and extend the forearm.</p>

<figure class="figleft illowp40" id="i_258" >
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_258.png" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption">THE ACTION OF THE MUSCLES ON THE FRAME COULD BE
SHOWN ON THE SCREEN.

<p class="subcap center">A series of drawings like this would be the first thing to prepare for
making the film.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>A similar animation
of the skeleton would
be that of the bony
levers in the human
frame. And as a comparison,
actual mechanical
levers of all three
orders could be made<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[259]</span>
to operate in connection with the levers in the
skeleton.</p>

<p>It would be possible, to some extent, to put
the “Origin of Species” on the screen with the
help of animated diagrams. For the vertebrates,
a section of the film could represent a schematic
evolutionary tree. On it, the lower forms of back-bone
life, such as amphibians and fishes, would be
placed on an offshoot near the lowest part of
the main trunk. Odd creatures like marsupials
would branch off a little higher up, and still higher
a larger branch of the tree would split into two
minor branches for reptiles and birds, respectively.</p>

<p>The tree would show above a branching off into
three important divisions for the ungulates, carnivores,
and quadrumana. The story could be
continued by separate delineations of the different
branches and tell in further detail the development
of the forms that belong to them.</p>

<p>The art of the animated cartoon and the educational
screen drawing has as yet not been developed
to its highest point. It needs, for one
thing, color. Such films are only shown, at present,
in monochrome or simple outlines. Of course<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[260]</span>
colored cartoons will come. Effecting the tinting
by hand would be easy as a process, but very
tedious and costly. A practical way of coloring
the ordinary photographic film is now in use by
tinting them with the aid of stencils. Both the
stencil-cutting and the coloring are accomplished
by the help of machinery.</p>

<p>At present there are color processes that produce
very beautiful photographs on the screen;
but they do not show, at least in those that so far
have come under the observation of the author, all
colors of nature. The craft is awaiting the inspired
inventor who will produce motion-pictures
in colors that will exhibit nature’s full range of
hues and shades. Then in comparison with Niepce’s
simple process, of about 1824, of fixing a lens-formed
image upon a metal plate coated with bitumen,
the photographic art will have attained to a
marvellous degree of technical development.</p>

<p>A consummate color process should reproduce,
too, an artist’s work upon the canvas without
losing any variations of hue that he has set forth.
Then it will be possible to have animated paintings.
One will go, when this wonder has been
achieved, to an exhibition gallery to see art<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[261]</span>
works with the additional interest of movement
as well as those of color and individual interpretation.
And, too, our museums will have projecting
rooms and fireproof libraries for keeping films.</p>

<p>It seems like fantastic dreaming to hold such
notions; but many things that were once considered
purely visionary—have now become commonplaces.</p>
